I'm happy with the service which, but that's just for me as I'm the lone admin.\n This new website is a separate venture. I expect several dozen users to be editing the site at the same time, and would like it to be very interactive and as instantaneous as possible. I plan on starting with the lowest tier options and upgrading as needed.\n Both companies offer a $100 credit for the first two months.

Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?\n ​\n DR:\n We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It's very similar to PiVPN.\n About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. \n For example, YouTube music says \"this service is not available in your country\" on the person's phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don't think their families were using any of these services, but can't be sure.\n We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it's always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.\n Does Anyone Else face this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/getwepn  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is the relevant bit from the link:\n  \nObfuscated servers are used to bypass VPN-blocking firewalls. To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. \n VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways. For example, data packets can be hidden using additional SSL/SSH encryption so that all the VPN metadata is out of sight. Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. \n Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header. This way, it looks like regular HTTPS traffic filled with meaningless information.

I figured it's best I mention my use case so here goes:\n  \nPlex server: I haven't decided on plex as such but seeing as it's the most common, I might start with it. I'm okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I'm only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn't be required, but I've read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I'd like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.\n Smarthome: This is the part that I haven't done any research on so excuse me if something doesn't make sense. From my understanding I'll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I'd like to be able to do this.\n Seedbox: I'm currently seeding about 60TB of \"linux iso's\". This is spread across 20k torrents. I'd want to move all this to the new server.\n File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.\n Security system: Camera's would output and store locally in this server.\n  \nThis is all I can think of for now but I'm pretty sure I'd need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?\n I'm pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones? I'd ideally want to run all this off a single synology nas but I don't know if that's possible.\n Oh and it's also worth mentioning that I live in a studio apartment so I wouldn't want a noisy server. That pretty much eliminates most Xeons.\n    submitted by    /u/Lumpy-Hedgehog-1479  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will be adding more containers for sure, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I'm using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn't going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?\n I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there's a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I'm not opposed to swapping nameservers.\n I'm sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I've spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along. Any tips/ideas would be welcome. Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/sorressean  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then I let it go... \n Now, about a year later however, I've decided to give it another shot, and I'm hoping I'll find someone willing to help me, if some unexpected trouble arise, that quick googling couldn't easily solve. \n So, my current \"setup\":\n I'm behind cg NAT, so no public IP, obviously.\n ​\n I wanted to start off clean, so:\n I have RPI4 available, I can install any supported os that you'd recommend, tho I'm pretty much counting on Raspbian lite (just that the last time I had to compile the wg for it from scratch, so, I hope i won't need to do that again...). \n I have my lite VPS running CentOS 7, also in a completely clean state, so far only purpose would be hosting the wg server. \n I'd normally just go with the \"first\" tutorial that google would find, but given that it pretty much didn't work out last time(s) I've been trying it, here I am, writing this post... \n So, if somebody has got a \"tried & true, verified working and not 3 years old\" tutorial working, for exactly this purpose, (exposing services from LAN) I'm down to just following it. \n But since I want to get it finally fully working this time, I figured I'll make a post, since honestly, I know a bit of Linux, and stuff, but god damn, sometimes I feel like I'm dense af... \n So... anybody with a bit of spare time to help this noobish fool, set this up?\n    submitted by    /u/Msprg  \n [link]   [comments]",

On that VM, i have about 20 docker containers running, including (but not limited too) Home assistant, Node Red, Pihole, Heimdal, Grocy, Organizr, Portainer, Grafana, InfluxDB, Zwave2Mqtt, ESPHome and some others.\n ​\n This afternoon, Im no longer able to access any of the web addresses, the folders shared via samba, or even SSH into the virtual machine. I can still access it on my virtual box when connecting to the mac mini. I've tried restarting and shutting down the VM, and even restarting services. Any idea what other options exist to try and get these functioning?\n I should mention that the docker containers are definitely running. And i can access home assistant through nabucasa. And automations and alexa integrations still work. I just can't access any services using the VM IP or Samab or SSH\n Never had to troubleshoot linux like this before. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks for any ideas and help.\n ​\n M\n    submitted by    /u/mew0717  \n [link]   [comments]",

Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.\n The solution I'm presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn't put all my brain cells into it)).\n What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)\n You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync\n I'm really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)\n I hope it will be useful to some people. Whether it's using the solution I propose or a solution based on the same principle but better suited to your own needs.\n I am of course open to all discussions and suggestions.\n PS : I'm not a native english speaker, I do my best.\n    submitted by    /u/Toutanus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe one board for each room and each big item could be a \"ticket\" (sofa/fridge etc). Then I could have To Buy/Bought/Delivered for each column and drag each item as needed. Suggestions for each item could be added as comments.\n Does this seem like a good idea? Or is there any other way people could think to organise something like this? I would love it if there were metadata that could be assigned to each item, so I could have a cost associated to a ticket then for each room I could see how much has been spent etc.\n Whatever solution has to be able to support images on tickets. Ideally I have to get my fiance to use and if the UI is not somewhat pretty/modern I know for a fact she won't use it, no matter how good it is.

How would I go about allowlisting only these IP addresses to access my newly exposed app, if at all possible?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/bix_box  \n [link]   [comments]",

While I've got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there's newer tech that is far more convenient. I'm super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) & allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I'm not even aware of! I'm less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.\n ​\n While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh & the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!\n ​\n I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I'm under the impression that the default used to be K8 & Docker & Ansible, but now it seems that K8 & Docker don't play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?\n ​\n Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management.

          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",
