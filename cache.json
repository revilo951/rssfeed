I'd like to use it to e.g. track wether my VPS hosting provider changes their pricings. I use Miniflux as my main news source, so it would be reallly useful if I could just add the RSS feed to Miniflux and see when the site contents change.\n Is there anyone that has a solution to this?

It backs up everything but consulting the pictures folders from the NextCloud app is a pain, it's slow, the UI is not polished at all, being more of a file manager than a photo manager. So I'm looking for a pretty self hosted service to manage my pictures!\n I'd like it to have an Android/iOS client that allows to see my NextCloud hosted photo backups also as my locally stored pictures while being able to delete both local/remote pictures to prevent useless pictures that would be stored on my NextCloud...\n It seems something along those lines is possible through Piwigo, however I don't think it can manage locally stored pictures, hence my question. It also seemed difficult to delete pictures both from Piwigo and NextCloud at the same time, unless by running some kind of Cron job\n Basically I'm looking for an all in one Gallery/Google Photo replacement that can handle multiple accounts (only one on the phone side, but multiple accounts for family members)\n Oh, of course, it would have to be hosted on Docker for ease of use (and also as my entire self hosted stack is running under Docker)\n Any suggestions?\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/moukrea  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll be running real time backups through BackBlaze B2 + weekly updates to an external drive.\n I run unRAID at home for a Plex Server with ~120TB of storage, and it's rock solid. But I'm looking elsewhere as the I/O capability of that system isn't great, and in this case it's likely multiple people will be reading and writing data throughout the day. I'm also considering using SSD storage for better local read/write speeds, which effectively removes unRAID as an option. Finally, while I'm happy to tinker in my spare time, whatever I end up setting up here will need to basically run itself, as my role will involve a hell of a lot more than just managing the IT infrastructure. \n So, to summarize - I know I can build a cheaper NAS with a lot more horsepower than what I'd buy from Synology - but I'm worried that NextCloud will require too much ongoing maintenance to make it worthwhile.

I have recently been diving into the selfhosted world, and have set up some game servers (minecraft, space engineers) as systemd services on a debian machine. I would like to be able to turn these on and off, as well see their current status from my browser, without needing to SSH into the server. Obviously I would create an unprivileged user with restricted access for this purpose, but my google-fu has been failing and I haven't been able to find any software that fits this use case. The server also has nginx serving some static pages, and I have the technical ability to create some webpages that call an api on my server, the question is what can I use to host those APIs? If anyone knows any software that can do this I'm all ears. Otherwise I might be making my own (and probably open-sourcing it) software or script to handle this.

Then sync and clear it when you get home.\n 3) get past some of the legal limitations for the radio chip. Fairphone and Pinephone still need a black box GSM chip. While any router does too, at least it opens up possibilities to swap it out for new developments.\n 4) get past the limitation of having only one vpn slot. Monitor AND shape your traffic with the flexibility of Linux.\n 5) no simcard = at least you know the phone is definitely off and not transmitting. Similar to hardware kill switches\n 6) get past some walled garden restrictions on apple when combined with censorship. Let's say you're in China but apple had to delete some anti surveillance app from the app store? The portable router could host that.\n 7) everything's going via the cloud these days. Get past Google's push for that with a local server. For example, the browser can't access the local file system anymore. Make a filesystem available via a Web service running on the router. *Save bandwidth and lag. *\n I'm sure there's a lot more that can be thought of. \n Drawbacks:\n 1) carrying 2 things 2) maybe all (some?.?) of this is too battery intensive?\n    submitted by    /u/After-Cell  \n [link]   [comments]",

During this entire time they've only used paper for the accounting and other financial tasks which I am now trying to help them move away from. They eventually asked if I could make a simple website for them and I said sure.\n First I wanted to see if the name for the business had been registered already. Google searched \"domain name search\" and the first result was namecheap. I go to the website to check and unsurprisingly it has not been taken. It was late so I decided I would work on it tomorrow but I ended up getting busy with some stuff and forgot about it for a couple days. 1-3 days pass and I go back to register it and I'm shocked to see \"This domain has recently been registered\". I do some further digging and found that the domain had never been registered once before. But coincidentally \"someone\" decided to register the domain using their service just a day or two after I had searched for it.\n To clarify, the business name is very unique and there is no business or service with anything similar or close to it. I contacted namecheap and they want hundreds of dollars for me to buy it. It's been a couple months and the domain is still parked and redirects to nothing other than their blank template \"This domain is registered at namecheap\" with a bunch of ads.\n    submitted by    /u/ixDamocles  \n [link]   [comments]",

LangaugeTool Homepage\n The entire proof reading engine can be run either through their Java server or in a docker image. Java\n Docker\n Another Docker Repo\n If you’re trying to set this up yourself I ran into one error that was undocumented but an easy fix. In the add on where u put in your server address make sure to put /v2 on the end or else it will result in the server getting a null request.\n Hopefully y’all find this helpful.

I've put together something that will take a photo from a webcam as well as various screenshots and send it to me in an email.\n I figured this could be useful for others as well and with the advice from a friend, I added a settings file of sorts so others could use it as well without having to learn to code or recompile it every time they make changes. Thanks, u/kizaing\n The Github Repo for this is https://github.com/vicelikedust/Login-Notifier\n Upon the first run of the executable, it will register itself with the Windows Task Scheduler. \n I believe I have exposed enough settings in the creds.json file, if not I gladly welcome suggestions and or people contributing to the repo.

So I tried the other services and none could be accessed. Connection time out, every time. I've been trying to fix for a few days now but can't seem to figure out the problem. I checked my firewall settings: the ports are open. I checked my router: the ports are forwarded properly. I'm pretty new to this so I don't know what else to check.\n I have another server (Server B) that's hosting a website, which can be accessed remotely. But it's got a domain name and DDNS set up, whereas when I access Server A, I just type in my home (external) IP. Maybe this has something to do with it?\n Any advice how I can troubleshoot or fix this?\n For info's sake: Server OS is Manjaro Firewall is UFW (used to be iptables but I disabled it because it was too complicated for me)\n    submitted by    /u/skullz3001AD  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know you can happily host keycloak to achieve what I'm describing, but I thought why not have a go at making my own identity provider...so I did.\n So I've built a service called Gatekeeper that I'm hoping the people of this subreddit may find useful for your labs. It's not the most feature rich service at the moment but I'm trying to add new features wherever I can. You can see what features it has on the README in the link above, but it currently supports\n  \nUser registration\n User login with TOTP MFA\n Email verification via \n AWS SES\n Mailgun\n (more providers to come)\n \n See what third party apps you authorised\n Support for OAuth2 authorization code, client credentials and refresh token flows\n and more with more to come\n  \nI'm hoping the README has enough information about what you need to get started if you want to give it try.

          "description": "I'm wondering if it's worth upgrading looking at one specific dimension...port forwarding.\n Current Setup:\n I have a Netgear Nighthawk R8000P and it works totally fine (note that I can't use DD-WRT as it's only compatible with the R8000 not the R8000P). I have some small services running on rpi's through a reverse proxy which gets 80/443 (+ a VPN port) forwarded from the router. For what it's worth, I get ~600mbps up and down.\n None of my services are super intensive. I'm a 1 person household, no gaming, just standard web browsing, netflix, etc. The router is pretty full featured and has a dual-core 1.8GHz cpu and 512mb RAM.\n Question:\n Is it worth getting a MikroTik hEX S or Ubiquiti USG or EdgeRouter X (let's ignore which one for now, don't want this to be a Ubiquiti vs MikroTik convo) to replace the wired routing capabilities of the R8000P? Specifically looking at port forwarding?\n My main concern is being as secure as possible when opening ports (yes, as much as possible is through the VPN, but sometimes you just gotta port forward, ya know?). The logs show that the R8000P is doing a pretty good job fending off multiple DoS attacks a day. I'm pretty sure the answer is the R8000P is just fine and it's just seeing all your shiny Ubiquiti and MikroTik setups that's getting to me... :)\n Thoughts?

          "description": "Hi out there,\n since some years I'm running Proxmox on old HP DL 360 G7 servers. A while ago I bought (really cheap) Sun F20 Flash Controllers with 4x24 GB Flash on board. I'm using two of them for zfs special devices, which works good.\n Now I was thinking if I could use the secound pair of them as mirrored zfs device for /. Space should be sufficiant (24 GB is enough for Proxmox) and use a SD-Card for /boot, as the F20 is not bootable. The advantage would be to have two more \"real\" drives for data.\n Has anyone ever done this? I'm not really sure how to start. To create a zfs device on the flash controller is no problem, moving all data should be no problem, too, but how can I make the sd card bootable (just grub install?) and tell the system to boot from the flash/zfs instead of the hard disks?\n Is this all in all a clever idea or does it make things unnecessary complex?\n Best regards!\n    submitted by    /u/martereddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems to be more and more common nowadays so I was hoping to be able to find a solution that would integrate all the necessary features/modules into a single portal to streamline things better.\n ​\n Hoping others in the community can help. I feel like I've been setting up lots of platforms and trials and wasting time to then come across something that falls short and is not negotiable. That being said I've tried to compile all that stuff I've come across on the various platforms into the following requirements that we need to be met. \n ​\n We would prefer open-source self-hosted most but that isn't a deal breaker. SaaS is acceptable so long as we can meet these reqiurements.\n ​\n Our requirements do not need to be filled by the vanilla platform itself but we do want to have a single portal. So for example, if a platform doesn't support RMM features that we require, then we'd still be okay with that platform as long as it has an RMM integration to become a part of the portal too. Essentially transparently integrating with the platform's portal so that it's like the platform does have it anyways.\n ​\n Requirements\n -White-labeling\n -capable of custom domain with https for the customer-facing portal/helpdesk\n -capable of SMTP for email\n -Ticketing/helpdesk that can create tickets from emails received and send a standard auto-reply to the customer\n -RMM agent\n -Knowledgebase that allows us to make articles visible to all customers or only some.\n -CRM\n ​\n Other conveniences that'd be nice to have but if we had none of these but met all our requirements it'd still be acceptable\n -Appointments/Calendar\n -Invoices: print/email/etc, process payments\n -Asset management\n -Credential management\n -Attachments/storage: some way to distribute file(s) if needed to a specified customer\n -Chat\n -Project management: for staff\n -Leads\n -Custom fields on customers, tickets, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/iamjdag  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I have the following very specific use case:\n I have a Yealink IP phone, which supports multiple contacts.\n I also have DECT phones, hooked up to my FRITZ!Box 7590. This FRITZ!Box 7590 supports pulling in a single CardDAV address book and pushing it to my DECT phones.\n My dad also has a Yealink IP phone.\n I would like to set up something where I can manage my DECT contacts, my IP phone contacts and my dad's IP phone contacts, exposing either two or three separate address books as CardDAV links. \n I very specifically want to be able to add a single contact to multiple address books, or group them some other way so that they end up in separate address books, without having to add a contact multiple times. The reason for this is that we share a lot of business contacts and family contacts (for the IP phones), but the DECT phones do not require those same contacts. Eventually I plan on migrating them to a router that has DECT support as well, so at that point I would require a fourth address book with the contacts that are only relevant to my parents, which I would like to organize in a separate group, but still expose in their combined address book.\n It would be stupidly simple to grab a CardDAV library, set up a database with the contacts and a relation table to assign them to an address book, then when a specific address book is requested pull up all contacts linked to it. But for some reason, I can't find any tools that support this.\n I've tried using NextCloud, but that only allows sharing address books, and does not allow assigning a contact to multiple address books. If you share an address book with another user, that book's contacts are not included in the user's main address book. You cannot expose a Group as a CardDAV link, and you cannot even assign contacts to a Circle at all.\n Does anyone know of a tool that can help me out here? Given how simple it would be, I find it difficult to believe that it wouldn't exist.\n    submitted by    /u/cS47f496tmQHavSR  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I mean by secured is where documents would be decrypted on demand. I kinda not feel OK with having all of my important documents lying around unencrypted on my cloud server. Maybe this is stupid. But I was wondering if such EDMS existed, one that would decrypt my documents only when needed but would let them crypted the rest of the time.\n Or maybe, I need some kind of local EDMS that I run against my documents stored in a crypted volume only when I need it?\n What's your opinion on this?\n    submitted by    /u/Erwyn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know I can use .home or .local, but I wanted to use a domain to get proper lets encrypt certificates.\n I am following Tom Lawrence's video on using HAProxy, Acme, and lets encrypt to setup what is essentially an internal only reverse proxy. (Refer to: How To Create pfsense Let's Encrypt Wildcard Certificates using HAProxy) I would like to type in cookbook.domain.tld instead of something like 192.168.100.20:9000 to access a docker webUI. I won't be opening anything to the public internet, so this webUI will only be accessible on my own network.\n Problem\n I need to move the DNS hosting aspect of my domain away from Namecheap. Namecheap does not provide API access unless I own 20+ domains. I have read great things about both Cloudflare & DigitalOcean. I think I will stick with Cloudflare as it is free. DigitalOcean is free if you pay for one of their other services, but at this time I do not.\n Question\n I'm not sure how to move the DNS Hosting from namecheap to Cloudflare. I don't even really know if I'm using the correct terminology. Could someone point me in the direction of what terminology I should be googling to find a tutorial/write up on moving DNS Hosting from NameCheap to Cloudflare? Or provide a simple overview of the steps needed?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/DeutscheAutoteknik  \n [link]   [comments]",

The stats had gone wrong after restarted the statping docker.\n So I decided to build my own one.\n In this project, I fully used socket.io as the backend and Vue 3 as the frontend.

Please let me know how I can improve the guide.\n Actually my initial idea worked, we just need to tell pihole that all requests which are served by Lancache should be redirected to it. Thankfully I was able to use a script provided by uklans to generate host entries that I can simply cat into pihole config. This is how I have done it without typing all the dns entries by hand:\n ssh to your pihole and execute the following commands:\n cd /home git clone https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains.git cd cache-domains/scripts nano config.json \n Paste the following content into the file and replace YourLancacheIp with the actual IP:\n { \"ips\": { \"generic\": \"YourLancacheIp\" }, \"cache_domains\": { \"default\": \"generic\" } } \n Now Ctrl+O to save the file and CTRL+X to close it. Now we let the script generate all the host files for us and insert them into pihole.\n sudo ./create-dnsmasq.sh cd output/dnsmasq cat * > /etc/pihole/custom.list \n That's it!

So bare with me…\n  \nTraefik vs Ngnix vs Caddy More than half the use of my NAS is Plex related (hence the **arrs), I’m really liking overseers GUI and integration into sonarr and radarr. I’d now like to put it to use and allow some of my PMS users to get their requests in from an external address of some sort (safest way possible without opening up the NAS to any attacks on open ports). I have heard varying things about Traefik and Ngnix until now and only Caddy as a result of finding this subreddit. What’s everyone’s personal preference and why? What’s easiest to get up and running? (Prefer systems with guis and easy to use)\n \nGetting things running smoothly - this question is in relation to the number of docker self hosted apps growing and the available stock ram that is being used. In addition to this when I remember to check in on portainer I notice a large number of unused images/instances that take up space. So questions are, upgrades to ram? Automated pruning and/or combinations of both to keep things running smoothly into the future.\n \n Thanks for reading this far if you made it.

That streamer is being served by a Raspi media server which is pulling music from a NAS. \n I want every device to be dedicated (i.e. No other software on the NAS).\n I know that Rune and Volumio are highly recommended, but I don't want to either: * Have a different operating system on the media server, or * Have the streamer pull from the NAS directly (if I can help it).\n Ultimately, if I have to install a specific distro on the streamer, I can.

          "description": "Hello! I’m a newbie to self hosting with limited linux experience but I like to tinker. \n I bought myself an Rpi4 and followed a YouTube guide on how to install basic web apps like OMV, Docker, Portainer, NPM and PiHole. \n While doing the above I found out that my ISP is under CGNAT and I couldn’t even access some of router configs to port forward. \n I found some tutorials (link below) to bypass this by creating a VPN tunnel to a VPS. I setup WireGuard accordingly on the Pi, bought a domain name and rented out a VPS on OVH. I also setup the domain on cloudflare as dns only\n The connection between the client(rpi4) and the host (VPS) is working out well tested thru ping but I still can’t access my web apps on the domain. \n I have been researching and testing out other tutorials for the matter for the past few weeks and I haven’t found an answer yet. I even had to reset the VPS and RPI4 bcoz I was experimenting with ufw firewall settings and I tried installing NPM on the VPS itself. \n Could anyone point me to the direction of what I need to learn in order to troubleshoot and fix this issue or if possible a probable solution?\n Thank you!\n This was the tutorial for setting up the WireGuard vpn\n    submitted by    /u/razzy1319  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I believe the last time I checked it was only suitable for deployment on a VPS and couldn't run on basic shared hosting w/o root permissions.\n Whenever I've used Wordpress, I end up paring down a lot of functionality from themes to get something that's as lightweight and fast as possible. I need some CMS that makes it easy to create text with the odd image -- and perhaps to also embed YouTube videos. But no functionality beyond that. \n Is there anything that could fit the bill for me?

I just don't know how to start.\n Basically, if one of my workers help someone and that help is concluded, that worker, \"worker jones\" will send an email to \"customer skinny Pete\". That email should contain a \"please rate my service\" thing that has maybe 3 to 5 smileys ranging from very happy to very sad. So If \"customer skinny Pete\" get's an email from worker.jones@mycompany.com, clicks on the very happy smiley, a browser link opens up and then it tells \"customer skinny Pete\" something like, thank you very much please add some feedback or what not or simply close the page. That's all \"customer skinny Pete\" needs to do.\n On my end, I should see something like who the customer was/or maybe it can be anonymous I don't know yet, but what im more interested in seeing is how many smileys, and the happiness of the smileys \"worker jones\" gets. This will maybe translate to happiness bonuses for \"worker jones\" and maybe \"worker Karen\" will stfu and do her job better?\n I hope I make sense...\n I suppose I could use WordPress for the website stuff?

I had some UI and usability improvements I'd like to try to propose for a fork / branch of BookStack ( https://www.bookstackapp.com/ ). I don't know if these ideas are really just front-end changes or if they require some alteration of how data is stored in the MySQL database.\n Idea:\n  \nMore like a collapsible tree / \"folder\" view of \"notebooks\" (what is currently called a Book) and support infinite depth of 'pages'. If you've ever used Onenote or clones, basically that type of organization. \n \nRemove UI clutter on \"home page\" and just get a tree list of the \"notebooks\" (collapsible) with the leaf page(s). I remember one of the views of Bookstack can do this but I don't think you can make it look like that on login and I remember this view still had some unwanted UI clutter (on the top-left?).\n \n If you're curious, I did propose these changes to the creator (Dan , who sometimes comments on these posts) but he's pretty happy with Shelves / Books / Chapters / Pages paradigm while I and my friends / family / colleagues didn't find that metaphor translated very well real world usage. I found myself having to explain the Bookstack's nomenclature many times while people were quickly productive with Onenote or Confluence (aside from the UI awkwardness surrounding Spaces).\n I respect that Bookstack is generously open-source and the author has created it primarily to serve his needs.\n Note: I'm an electronics engineer / embedded programmer / FPGA person by degrees and work experience but have become proficient and reasonable capable in doing lightweight DevOps / self-hosting.

Starting them all up can be annoying and I ended up writing my own bash script to recurse through the folders and run Docker compose up on the yaml files, but that's clunky. \n It also becomes difficult to actually manage or troubleshoot any of the services because I have to cd to the directory first to then type cumbersome docker-compose commands. Although Portainer may help with that, I haven't installed it or used it yet.\n How my secrets are currently stored with the docker compose setup is also a mess, some of them are directly in the compose files, most of them are in a .env file but both ways suck in my opinion.\n I've read that kubernetes has better secret management and coupled with rancher I have a fully featured web management panel. I believe the rancher web UI even has terminal emulator too?\n Is the kubernetes secret management worth it for a single node cluster? Are there any other kubernetes features that I may find helpful?\n At a higher level about orchestration: if I add two or more nodes to a kubernetes cluster, does it only make sense if those nodes are able to communicate with very low latency? (I.e multiple raspberry pies in my house or multiple servers in the same data center)?\n If I were to sign up for the Oracle free forever VM, would it make sense to add it as another node in my kubernetes cluster?

So I’d be very curious to hear what you think of it, if you encounter any bugs, or what features you think are still missing.\n Here are some of the new features that I added since I last posted here:\n  \nWYSIWYG editor\n Click/open tracking\n Visual Template editor\n Template fully tested in Outlook, MS Mail, all other major clients\n Campaign scheduling\n Improved dark theme (and still no light theme)\n  \nIt’s now also much easier to install Keila since it now has automatic database migrations in place.\n Some features that are still planned for v1.0:\n  \nContact quality monitoring & bounce handling\n Custom contact fields + segmentation\n Image/attachment uploads\n Contact syncing API/Webhooks\n Drip-style email automations\n  \nYou can find more information about the project on keila.io or on GitHub.\n If you want to give Keila a try without installing it yourself, you can check out the hosted version of Keila here.\n For installing it on your own server, take a look at the installation guide.\n    submitted by    /u/wmnnd  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are some self-hosted applications for using an actual LDAP setup?\n I was thinking of possibly setting up an LDAP instance on a server machine in my lab, and then dictating it somehow that if any computer that connects is registered as a machine on the network, then I could automount the drives of that server.\n Would this be a good example of using LDAP in a selfhosted lab?\n What are some examples that you guys have deployed for LDAP?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BackToPlebbit69  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a synology nas at home (ds918+) and I like some features offered by audiostation, sunllogy's official package for music streaming, but I have some troubles with large music collection.\n Then, I thought I could ask you directly what are your recommendations for a streaming application that would meet some criteria : - Can be deployed on docker (or on synology directly) - Suited for large collections of songs - Has an android app to stream on phone - Can play to mulpile dlna devices at home at the same time (ds audio offers it by selecting multiple devices at the same time, but it gets buggy and I often need to restart server)\n Any suggestions of something that would meet those criterias? I tried plex, as I'm using it for my series, but it doesn't support multiple dlna at the same time.\n Thank you in advance for your help :)\n    submitted by    /u/Afaren42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a few things I'd prefer to have some \"service\" running on web GUI if possible.\n Things are: 4. Web-based file manager. I use TinyFileManager or FileRun 5. docker management. I use portainer. 6. server health monitoring. i can use cockpit.\n Things I'm looking for:\n A. I really would like to ask for advice for a KVM-QEMU web-based admin, kinda like virt-manager, but run totally on the web interface with display on web-VNC--like what TrueNAS Scale or Synology DSM offers. I'm looking at this list from KVM site and would appreciate any pointers.\n B.

If there is any issue with it, I am screwed out of my files.\n  \nI would like to get a second server that can remain up while the other one is down. Ultimately, I would like it to be able to scale so that I have a third server at home, and not have to change anything to the infrastrucure.\n So in essence, I am asking for a scalable distributed filesystem that would handle replication transparently across the nodes and abstract the storage so that I can either access it in an unique way from various cloud storage server instances (e.g. NextCloud) or by mounting it directly from my client home machines.\n Right now I am looking at object storage like OpenIO, CEPH or MinIO, however I get the feeling that they are intended for high performance servers and what I have may not cut it, especially with regards to network latency.\n I don't need high performance when writing, but I would like to be able to stream video from it; so if the solution can do full replication instead of striping, that would allow streaming from the local node only and we should be good.\n Am I looking in the right direction?

Possibly because I'm bored and want to learn new tools and information I'm interested in learning about HA setups. I've tinkered with Docker Swarm, however it seems most of the information on web is really focused on K8s. I've recently watched a lot videos on Consul and K3s and it seems like a lot of the concepts with these setups are the same. I'm struggling however with terminology, ingress controllers and honestly with a lot of examples pulling in things that aren't explained very well -- such as manifests and service files. What are some good resources to learn about this technology? I'm not opposed for paying for courses. K3s seems to be possibly more applicable for homelab than K8s since I don't need all the cloud technology backed into the software however I'm not sure if I'm even asking the right questions.\n Thanks for any opinions and comments regarding resources I should consult.\n    submitted by    /u/kevdogger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also I run chrome Remote Desktop so that I can monitor and tinker remotely when I have downtime at work. But in the last month, I’ve come home to see my gpu at 100% usage, and the first time the person had it set to disable when in use, so I only noticed it because I have AIDA64 on a mini monitor and digging through task manager I found they had installed an exe in a public folder. The second time it happened was yesterday. I noticed the usage, immediately went through all the steps to remove it again, but there it was in a public folder. \n With that said how can I have all these things that are connected or connectable outside my home network without the risk of those same ports being used by nefarious people?\n At this point I’ve killed all access and locked down my firewall. But what can I do differently, or is this just the risk that comes with all that?\n The worst part is after the first time I installed Acronis True Image which offers cryptojacking protection specifically. Needless to say it was completely useless in preventing the second attack. \n I’m sorry if this is not a good place for this, but I feel like someone new to self-hosting, could also experience these seem attacks.\n EDIT 1: Followed a ton of advice about killing rdp. Did that. Somehow- this person connected again, via power shell and did their thing and installed their stuff again.\n This is with glasswire, windows firewall and Acronus protection all running and nothing caught it.

          "description": "Hey guys n ladies! :)\n I‘ve a question related to this posts title.\n I set up a nextcloud server with a storage box on a Hetzner server. Working really good (went the docker way) and i like nextcloud pretty much.\n The main purpose i am using a VPS with a storage box is that my internet connection at home is pretty slow (80/15) regarding file transfer. If my upload would be better i would have hosted everything locally, maybe in the future.\n So i would like to have a bidirectional sync between my Nextcloud data and a local folder on my synology nas. This way all my files are in my local network and i could access them quickly because of gbit lan and on the other side i can access them quickly everywhere else because of the good upload speed from the VPS.\n And the main reason is also that if i change files locally, they can be synced to my nextcloud and vice versa.\n The only way i found would be WebDAV with Cloud Sync. But is that the best and only way?\n I tried also with a vpn connection and mount the nextcloud files folder to the nas and with sftp mount. Then with rsync, but thats not really working like i want to.\n Du you have some ideas?\n Greetings :)\n    submitted by    /u/Bleala  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got it running qBittorrent-nox, Aria2 (following this and this tutorials,with AriaNg frontend served via Apache), and filebrowser/SFTP/Samba for file access. I had some other services running, but I've stopped them for the moment. I've set Aria2 and qBittorrent to download to /media/pi/Downloads, which is the automatic mount point for my 500GB HDD (NTFS, via FUSE)\n Problem: \n It doesn't download torrents. When I add a torrent in qBittorrent web interface, it'll grab the metadata, list tens or hundreds of peers, then I'll watch the download speed drop down from KB/s to bytes/s to zero and stop. The same torrent, when added to the Aria2 web interface, will download slowly (though I have seen the first one I tried download at 4 Mbit/s which is very good for my internet). I'm nervous to stick exclusively with Aria2, however, as, despite downloading the torrents, I can't tell whether it seeds them or not. It goes into \"seeding\" mode, but uploads remain at 0 Kb/s. I need to be able to seed, to use it with a private tracker or two.\n Question:\n Can anyone please help me figure out what's wrong with qBittorrent, why it's not downloading or seeding torrents, and how to fix it? Is Aria2 actually seeding and I just can't see it? Is there any way to tell?\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/neusymar  \n [link]   [comments]",

My goal would be to sync my photos from laptop and phone to nextcloud and have photoprism recognize all important features.\n A few questions arise when reading through it all: -does photoprism need to make a extra copy of that file? Or will it just add all the info to the \"nextcloud\" photo. (plenty of storage, so not a major issue) -will the photoprism info also show in the nextcloud environment? -is there a android app to browse through my photos or can I only access it via webinterface -does it change file structure (Pictures/2021/2021-01/filename.jpg)\n Ideally all my photos would be indexed/labeled on all devices so a backwards sync option would be great but not sure that is in the scope of all platforms involved. \n Is there a clear instruction to run it without docker?\n    submitted by    /u/seabird1974  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does it work well enough? Have you had the chance to compare it with Dietpi's version?\n    submitted by    /u/eed00  \n [link]   [comments]",

It uses the Metadata in the files and can use the cover art in the same folder as the Songs/Album. It is 100% free (GPL3) software. Including the javascript(LibreJS compatible). It consists of a back-end service written in rust called Soil and a Typescript front-end called Solanum.\n Your songs will transparently be transcoded to a format that your Browser will understand if required.\n While Hypnos is still very primitive in many areas (no playlist, no user management, etc..) the core feature browsing an playing your Music works.\n I'm posting this here in case some of you find Hypnos interesting/useful.\n    submitted by    /u/Serranya  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a nightmare. The only solution I see is to either hire a sysadmin to do this for me, or to look for alternatives.\n Anyway, sorry about the rant. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n I've also considered just dumping pterodactyl entirely and just building my own docker images with the servers I need. Would that be a better idea?\n    submitted by    /u/HaedHutner  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know there are lots of services that can replace some individually (like using NextCloud), but I am looking for what the best options are. One thing that I am really wanting is something similar to iMazing which looks like an amazing product but just a little outside my use case (and if something else will do it for free, all the better).\n What I like about iMazing is that I can backup and manage all of my data (messages, photos, apps, the works) from a remote location with a UI that is very similar to iTunes. I'm trying to set up a family backup of photos and iPhones for my parents and siblings and so having that ease of use is key. The downside of iMazing is that the unlimited plan only lets me have 2 computers with keys so only myself and one other household can manage their devices or I can get lifetime keys for 10 devices but I need more future proofing because we will have more iPhones in the family inevitably. \n What is your setup for iOS backup and management for your home setups and specifically what is your ideal photo backup setup that you use for those people who aren't tech savvy (i.e parents/siblings).\n    submitted by    /u/wmsmckay  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, first time posting to this sub. I've spent the last week scouring the interwebs and I haven't found anyone talking about what I'm trying to do. Any help would be very greatly appreciated. \n I'm trying to connect two remote locations together. Both locations have a dynamic IP address. Everything I've seen so far has suggested using a Dynamic DNS service or buying a domain name and using a free Dynamic DNS. Those are great ideas but I know there's got to be a way to do this for free. If it can't be done, then it can't be done, but purely on principle I feel like it's total bullshit that there's no free alternatives that don't rely on the whim of an ISP or third party services. \n This is what I was thinking, neither IP changes all that frequently, maybe once every month or 2. Additionally, it seems very unlikely that both IP's would change at exactly the same time. Would it be possible to run an automatic process at both locations that would constantly update their IP's to one another? \n So we have location A and location B that constantly talk to each other and update the IP address. At location A, the IP address changes. Now, location B doest know the new IP address of location A. Because the two IP's didn't change at the same time, location A still knows the IP address of location B and subsequently can send the updated IP address. \n Anyone know if anything like this exists or have any ideas for free alternatives? \n On a side note, I have an old TPlink Archer A9 that I'm not using, it has a free Built-in ddns with tp-link. I switched over to an edge router. Is there anyway I could put the A9 in a DMZ on the network and have it only for updating the ddns? Could I switch to IPV6?\n Honestly, any free and automated ideas would be perfect.

There are a lot of desktop apps for almost every system and mobile apps for iOS and Android. \n With optional end-to-end encryption, you also have one of the most secure note servers around.\n https://ae3.ch/joplin-server-on-docker-with-traefik-and-ssl\n Let me know what you think of Joplin Server.
