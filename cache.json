Never ran into any issues but then again I haven't been away from my house in the last year and half.\n Recently I was working away from home and noticed Nextcloud wasn't syncing. So I tried the other services and none could be accessed. Connection time out, every time. I've been trying to fix for a few days now but can't seem to figure out the problem. I checked my firewall settings: the ports are open. I checked my router: the ports are forwarded properly. I'm pretty new to this so I don't know what else to check.\n I have another server (Server B) that's hosting a website, which can be accessed remotely. But it's got a domain name and DDNS set up, whereas when I access Server A, I just type in my home (external) IP. Maybe this has something to do with it?\n Any advice how I can troubleshoot or fix this?\n For info's sake: Server OS is Manjaro Firewall is UFW (used to be iptables but I disabled it because it was too complicated for me)\n    submitted by    /u/skullz3001AD  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know you can happily host keycloak to achieve what I'm describing, but I thought why not have a go at making my own identity provider...so I did.\n So I've built a service called Gatekeeper that I'm hoping the people of this subreddit may find useful for your labs. It's not the most feature rich service at the moment but I'm trying to add new features wherever I can. You can see what features it has on the README in the link above, but it currently supports\n  \nUser registration\n User login with TOTP MFA\n Email verification via \n AWS SES\n Mailgun\n (more providers to come)\n \n See what third party apps you authorised\n Support for OAuth2 authorization code, client credentials and refresh token flows\n and more with more to come\n  \nI'm hoping the README has enough information about what you need to get started if you want to give it try.

          "description": "I'm wondering if it's worth upgrading looking at one specific dimension...port forwarding.\n Current Setup:\n I have a Netgear Nighthawk R8000P and it works totally fine (note that I can't use DD-WRT as it's only compatible with the R8000 not the R8000P). I have some small services running on rpi's through a reverse proxy which gets 80/443 (+ a VPN port) forwarded from the router. For what it's worth, I get ~600mbps up and down.\n None of my services are super intensive. I'm a 1 person household, no gaming, just standard web browsing, netflix, etc. The router is pretty full featured and has a dual-core 1.8GHz cpu and 512mb RAM.\n Question:\n Is it worth getting a MikroTik hEX S or Ubiquiti USG or EdgeRouter X (let's ignore which one for now, don't want this to be a Ubiquiti vs MikroTik convo) to replace the wired routing capabilities of the R8000P? Specifically looking at port forwarding?\n My main concern is being as secure as possible when opening ports (yes, as much as possible is through the VPN, but sometimes you just gotta port forward, ya know?). The logs show that the R8000P is doing a pretty good job fending off multiple DoS attacks a day. I'm pretty sure the answer is the R8000P is just fine and it's just seeing all your shiny Ubiquiti and MikroTik setups that's getting to me... :)\n Thoughts?

          "description": "What I'm looking for is a platform that has features from MSP, RMM and PSA platforms. It seems to be more and more common nowadays so I was hoping to be able to find a solution that would integrate all the necessary features/modules into a single portal to streamline things better.\n ​\n Hoping others in the community can help. I feel like I've been setting up lots of platforms and trials and wasting time to then come across something that falls short and is not negotiable. That being said I've tried to compile all that stuff I've come across on the various platforms into the following requirements that we need to be met. \n ​\n We would prefer open-source self-hosted most but that isn't a deal breaker. SaaS is acceptable so long as we can meet these reqiurements.\n ​\n Our requirements do not need to be filled by the vanilla platform itself but we do want to have a single portal. So for example, if a platform doesn't support RMM features that we require, then we'd still be okay with that platform as long as it has an RMM integration to become a part of the portal too. Essentially transparently integrating with the platform's portal so that it's like the platform does have it anyways.\n ​\n Requirements\n -White-labeling\n -capable of custom domain with https for the customer-facing portal/helpdesk\n -capable of SMTP for email\n -Ticketing/helpdesk that can create tickets from emails received and send a standard auto-reply to the customer\n -RMM agent\n -Knowledgebase that allows us to make articles visible to all customers or only some.\n -CRM\n ​\n Other conveniences that'd be nice to have but if we had none of these but met all our requirements it'd still be acceptable\n -Appointments/Calendar\n -Invoices: print/email/etc, process payments\n -Asset management\n -Credential management\n -Attachments/storage: some way to distribute file(s) if needed to a specified customer\n -Chat\n -Project management: for staff\n -Leads\n -Custom fields on customers, tickets, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/iamjdag  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I have the following very specific use case:\n I have a Yealink IP phone, which supports multiple contacts.\n I also have DECT phones, hooked up to my FRITZ!Box 7590. This FRITZ!Box 7590 supports pulling in a single CardDAV address book and pushing it to my DECT phones.\n My dad also has a Yealink IP phone.\n I would like to set up something where I can manage my DECT contacts, my IP phone contacts and my dad's IP phone contacts, exposing either two or three separate address books as CardDAV links. \n I very specifically want to be able to add a single contact to multiple address books, or group them some other way so that they end up in separate address books, without having to add a contact multiple times. The reason for this is that we share a lot of business contacts and family contacts (for the IP phones), but the DECT phones do not require those same contacts. Eventually I plan on migrating them to a router that has DECT support as well, so at that point I would require a fourth address book with the contacts that are only relevant to my parents, which I would like to organize in a separate group, but still expose in their combined address book.\n It would be stupidly simple to grab a CardDAV library, set up a database with the contacts and a relation table to assign them to an address book, then when a specific address book is requested pull up all contacts linked to it. But for some reason, I can't find any tools that support this.\n I've tried using NextCloud, but that only allows sharing address books, and does not allow assigning a contact to multiple address books. If you share an address book with another user, that book's contacts are not included in the user's main address book. You cannot expose a Group as a CardDAV link, and you cannot even assign contacts to a Circle at all.\n Does anyone know of a tool that can help me out here? Given how simple it would be, I find it difficult to believe that it wouldn't exist.\n    submitted by    /u/cS47f496tmQHavSR  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently using multiple Virtualbox VMs with Win10, CCProxy server and OpenVPN client; i start the VM, connect to the desired VPN, run CCProxy and access the proxy server on 192.168.x.x. It works great, but it's extremely wasteful, especially when i run 10 VMs at the same time. Is there any (easy) method i could do that inside a LXC? My VPN provider supports L2TP/IPsec, IKEv1, IKEv2, OpenVPN and Wireguard; the proxy can be HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS 4, SOCKS 4a or SOCKS 5. \n If anyone is curious why i would need that - a download manager i'm using (JDownloader2) supports just proxy servers and i figured why pay for premium filehost traffic if i can just use my existing VPN subscription to download 10 files in free mode at the same time.\n    submitted by    /u/tstddj  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all-\n Background\n I've been selfhosting internal services for a few years but I'm pretty new to public internet networking topics such as DNS hosting, DNS records, etc.\n I have purchased a domain to use for my internal/local domain. I know I can use .home or .local, but I wanted to use a domain to get proper lets encrypt certificates.\n I am following Tom Lawrence's video on using HAProxy, Acme, and lets encrypt to setup what is essentially an internal only reverse proxy. (Refer to: How To Create pfsense Let's Encrypt Wildcard Certificates using HAProxy) I would like to type in cookbook.domain.tld instead of something like 192.168.100.20:9000 to access a docker webUI. I won't be opening anything to the public internet, so this webUI will only be accessible on my own network.\n Problem\n I need to move the DNS hosting aspect of my domain away from Namecheap. Namecheap does not provide API access unless I own 20+ domains. I have read great things about both Cloudflare & DigitalOcean. I think I will stick with Cloudflare as it is free. DigitalOcean is free if you pay for one of their other services, but at this time I do not.\n Question\n I'm not sure how to move the DNS Hosting from namecheap to Cloudflare. I don't even really know if I'm using the correct terminology. Could someone point me in the direction of what terminology I should be googling to find a tutorial/write up on moving DNS Hosting from NameCheap to Cloudflare? Or provide a simple overview of the steps needed?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/DeutscheAutoteknik  \n [link]   [comments]",

Though a lot of redditors here suggested statping here, unfortunately, it is not so stable in deep. I could not get downtime alert. I could not set the private channel for Telegram alert. The stats had gone wrong after restarted the statping docker.\n So I decided to build my own one.\n In this project, I fully used socket.io as the backend and Vue 3 as the frontend.

Please let me know how I can improve the guide.\n Actually my initial idea worked, we just need to tell pihole that all requests which are served by Lancache should be redirected to it. Thankfully I was able to use a script provided by uklans to generate host entries that I can simply cat into pihole config. This is how I have done it without typing all the dns entries by hand:\n ssh to your pihole and execute the following commands:\n cd /home git clone https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains.git cd cache-domains/scripts nano config.json \n Paste the following content into the file and replace YourLancacheIp with the actual IP:\n { \"ips\": { \"generic\": \"YourLancacheIp\" }, \"cache_domains\": { \"default\": \"generic\" } } \n Now Ctrl+O to save the file and CTRL+X to close it. Now we let the script generate all the host files for us and insert them into pihole.\n sudo ./create-dnsmasq.sh cd output/dnsmasq cat * > /etc/pihole/custom.list \n That's it! You can check if everything works by going into the pihole admin panel and look under Local DNS > DNS Records\n    submitted by    /u/Ksdmg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I’ve been running my Synology DS920+ for about 6 months now and love it as a tinkering/home lab tool. That all being said it’s now running 15 or more docker containers for various things from all the **arrs, overseer, heimdall, yacht, portainer, home assistant, homebridge etc.\n I’d now like to step the game up a little by making it run smarter and faster, so this is going to be a two bit extended question. So bare with me…\n  \nTraefik vs Ngnix vs Caddy More than half the use of my NAS is Plex related (hence the **arrs), I’m really liking overseers GUI and integration into sonarr and radarr. I’d now like to put it to use and allow some of my PMS users to get their requests in from an external address of some sort (safest way possible without opening up the NAS to any attacks on open ports). I have heard varying things about Traefik and Ngnix until now and only Caddy as a result of finding this subreddit. What’s everyone’s personal preference and why? What’s easiest to get up and running? (Prefer systems with guis and easy to use)\n \nGetting things running smoothly - this question is in relation to the number of docker self hosted apps growing and the available stock ram that is being used. In addition to this when I remember to check in on portainer I notice a large number of unused images/instances that take up space. So questions are, upgrades to ram? Automated pruning and/or combinations of both to keep things running smoothly into the future.\n \n Thanks for reading this far if you made it. Any help is greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/mingleman82  \n [link]   [comments]",

I enjoy having my network very segmented, so I use one device for a few dedicated things.\n What I would essentially like to do is have my Media server serve audio to another Raspi connected to a stereo to have a media player (Streamer). This would be controlled by a tablet that can choose the music to be played.\n My questions are: \n  \nIf I put a player on that Streamer and have it running on a web server, what device will it play to when I access it in the browser on the tablet? Will it play on the tablet or on the headless Streamer?\n \nIs Airsonic my best bet, or should I go with something else? \n \nIf Airsonic is not the best, what can I put on my media server to serve music without having a dedicated OS?\n \n EDIT What I want is a tablet that anyone in the house can use to control various things (lights through Home Assistant, music, etc.) That tablet can control a Raspi streamer. That streamer is being served by a Raspi media server which is pulling music from a NAS. \n I want every device to be dedicated (i.e. No other software on the NAS).\n I know that Rune and Volumio are highly recommended, but I don't want to either: * Have a different operating system on the media server, or * Have the streamer pull from the NAS directly (if I can help it).\n Ultimately, if I have to install a specific distro on the streamer, I can.

I currently blog on Medium just because it's super easy and fast.\n However, I have a whole network of domains and - because I generally try to self-host vs. use SaaS whenever possible - would much rather deploy something that I manage and control.\n Ghost.org seems to be a recurrent recommendation for a self-hostable platform that mirrors Medium's functionality (lightweight UI, fast). However I believe the last time I checked it was only suitable for deployment on a VPS and couldn't run on basic shared hosting w/o root permissions.\n Whenever I've used Wordpress, I end up paring down a lot of functionality from themes to get something that's as lightweight and fast as possible. I need some CMS that makes it easy to create text with the odd image -- and perhaps to also embed YouTube videos. But no functionality beyond that. \n Is there anything that could fit the bill for me? Obviously there's Wordpress but the whole reason I'm not posting using it right now is that I find it bloated and slow compared to Medium.\n Thanks for any suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/danielrosehill  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone.\n I would like to have my own something like nicerepely or SimpleSat. I kind of have an idea... I just don't know how to start.\n Basically, if one of my workers help someone and that help is concluded, that worker, \"worker jones\" will send an email to \"customer skinny Pete\". That email should contain a \"please rate my service\" thing that has maybe 3 to 5 smileys ranging from very happy to very sad. So If \"customer skinny Pete\" get's an email from worker.jones@mycompany.com, clicks on the very happy smiley, a browser link opens up and then it tells \"customer skinny Pete\" something like, thank you very much please add some feedback or what not or simply close the page. That's all \"customer skinny Pete\" needs to do.\n On my end, I should see something like who the customer was/or maybe it can be anonymous I don't know yet, but what im more interested in seeing is how many smileys, and the happiness of the smileys \"worker jones\" gets. This will maybe translate to happiness bonuses for \"worker jones\" and maybe \"worker Karen\" will stfu and do her job better?\n I hope I make sense...\n I suppose I could use WordPress for the website stuff? Or would something else be better for this? SimpleSat is more in line with what I would prefer... but at $79 dollars per month... that's allot of money for us south Africans...\n Your help / suggestions would sure be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/R3D_R4NG3R  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys,\n Wondering if there are any PHP / Laravel / web developers or experts who might have a few spare cycles. I had some UI and usability improvements I'd like to try to propose for a fork / branch of BookStack ( https://www.bookstackapp.com/ ). I don't know if these ideas are really just front-end changes or if they require some alteration of how data is stored in the MySQL database.\n Idea:\n  \nMore like a collapsible tree / \"folder\" view of \"notebooks\" (what is currently called a Book) and support infinite depth of 'pages'. If you've ever used Onenote or clones, basically that type of organization. \n \nRemove UI clutter on \"home page\" and just get a tree list of the \"notebooks\" (collapsible) with the leaf page(s). I remember one of the views of Bookstack can do this but I don't think you can make it look like that on login and I remember this view still had some unwanted UI clutter (on the top-left?).\n \n If you're curious, I did propose these changes to the creator (Dan , who sometimes comments on these posts) but he's pretty happy with Shelves / Books / Chapters / Pages paradigm while I and my friends / family / colleagues didn't find that metaphor translated very well real world usage. I found myself having to explain the Bookstack's nomenclature many times while people were quickly productive with Onenote or Confluence (aside from the UI awkwardness surrounding Spaces).\n I respect that Bookstack is generously open-source and the author has created it primarily to serve his needs.\n Note: I'm an electronics engineer / embedded programmer / FPGA person by degrees and work experience but have become proficient and reasonable capable in doing lightweight DevOps / self-hosting. Not a PHP or \"front-end\" expert but happy to do what I can to help/contribute.\n    submitted by    /u/bitandquit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If I install kubernetes (or rather k3s and/or rancher) on a singular node (I rent one remote server), does it actually provide me with any practically useful benefits?\n My current setup is using Docker compose and I have different folders with their own yaml files for groups of services (e.g 01-reverseproxy and 02-nextcloud). Starting them all up can be annoying and I ended up writing my own bash script to recurse through the folders and run Docker compose up on the yaml files, but that's clunky. \n It also becomes difficult to actually manage or troubleshoot any of the services because I have to cd to the directory first to then type cumbersome docker-compose commands. Although Portainer may help with that, I haven't installed it or used it yet.\n How my secrets are currently stored with the docker compose setup is also a mess, some of them are directly in the compose files, most of them are in a .env file but both ways suck in my opinion.\n I've read that kubernetes has better secret management and coupled with rancher I have a fully featured web management panel. I believe the rancher web UI even has terminal emulator too?\n Is the kubernetes secret management worth it for a single node cluster? Are there any other kubernetes features that I may find helpful?\n At a higher level about orchestration: if I add two or more nodes to a kubernetes cluster, does it only make sense if those nodes are able to communicate with very low latency? (I.e multiple raspberry pies in my house or multiple servers in the same data center)?\n If I were to sign up for the Oracle free forever VM, would it make sense to add it as another node in my kubernetes cluster?

So I’d be very curious to hear what you think of it, if you encounter any bugs, or what features you think are still missing.\n Here are some of the new features that I added since I last posted here:\n  \nWYSIWYG editor\n Click/open tracking\n Visual Template editor\n Template fully tested in Outlook, MS Mail, all other major clients\n Campaign scheduling\n Improved dark theme (and still no light theme)\n  \nIt’s now also much easier to install Keila since it now has automatic database migrations in place.\n Some features that are still planned for v1.0:\n  \nContact quality monitoring & bounce handling\n Custom contact fields + segmentation\n Image/attachment uploads\n Contact syncing API/Webhooks\n Drip-style email automations\n  \nYou can find more information about the project on keila.io or on GitHub.\n If you want to give Keila a try without installing it yourself, you can check out the hosted version of Keila here.\n For installing it on your own server, take a look at the installation guide.\n    submitted by    /u/wmnnd  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are some self-hosted applications for using an actual LDAP setup?\n I was thinking of possibly setting up an LDAP instance on a server machine in my lab, and then dictating it somehow that if any computer that connects is registered as a machine on the network, then I could automount the drives of that server.\n Would this be a good example of using LDAP in a selfhosted lab?\n What are some examples that you guys have deployed for LDAP?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BackToPlebbit69  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a few things I'd prefer to have some \"service\" running on web GUI if possible.\n Things are: 4. Web-based file manager. I use TinyFileManager or FileRun 5. docker management. I use portainer. 6. server health monitoring. i can use cockpit.\n Things I'm looking for:\n A. I really would like to ask for advice for a KVM-QEMU web-based admin, kinda like virt-manager, but run totally on the web interface with display on web-VNC--like what TrueNAS Scale or Synology DSM offers. I'm looking at this list from KVM site and would appreciate any pointers.\n B. Web GUI to manage my scheduled snapshots (commanding sanoid basically).\n I'd appreciate any recommendation for solving A & B above.\n Thanks a lot for any advice in advance!

If there is any issue with it, I am screwed out of my files.\n  \nI would like to get a second server that can remain up while the other one is down. Ultimately, I would like it to be able to scale so that I have a third server at home, and not have to change anything to the infrastrucure.\n So in essence, I am asking for a scalable distributed filesystem that would handle replication transparently across the nodes and abstract the storage so that I can either access it in an unique way from various cloud storage server instances (e.g. NextCloud) or by mounting it directly from my client home machines.\n Right now I am looking at object storage like OpenIO, CEPH or MinIO, however I get the feeling that they are intended for high performance servers and what I have may not cut it, especially with regards to network latency.\n I don't need high performance when writing, but I would like to be able to stream video from it; so if the solution can do full replication instead of striping, that would allow streaming from the local node only and we should be good.\n Am I looking in the right direction?

          "description": "So I’m running Ombi and Plex, for myself and my family consistently, as well as some fun things here and there from this subreddit as things pop up. Also I run chrome Remote Desktop so that I can monitor and tinker remotely when I have downtime at work. But in the last month, I’ve come home to see my gpu at 100% usage, and the first time the person had it set to disable when in use, so I only noticed it because I have AIDA64 on a mini monitor and digging through task manager I found they had installed an exe in a public folder. The second time it happened was yesterday. I noticed the usage, immediately went through all the steps to remove it again, but there it was in a public folder. \n With that said how can I have all these things that are connected or connectable outside my home network without the risk of those same ports being used by nefarious people?\n At this point I’ve killed all access and locked down my firewall. But what can I do differently, or is this just the risk that comes with all that?\n The worst part is after the first time I installed Acronis True Image which offers cryptojacking protection specifically. Needless to say it was completely useless in preventing the second attack. \n I’m sorry if this is not a good place for this, but I feel like someone new to self-hosting, could also experience these seem attacks.\n EDIT 1: Followed a ton of advice about killing rdp. Did that. Somehow- this person connected again, via power shell and did their thing and installed their stuff again.\n This is with glasswire, windows firewall and Acronus protection all running and nothing caught it.

For what I wanted to achieve though, these all seemed overkill.\n In the meantime, the cameras arrived and I quickly discovered that these Reolink cameras have their own in-built motion detection and are able to upload clips to an FTP server upon detection.

Working really good (went the docker way) and i like nextcloud pretty much.\n The main purpose i am using a VPS with a storage box is that my internet connection at home is pretty slow (80/15) regarding file transfer. If my upload would be better i would have hosted everything locally, maybe in the future.\n So i would like to have a bidirectional sync between my Nextcloud data and a local folder on my synology nas. This way all my files are in my local network and i could access them quickly because of gbit lan and on the other side i can access them quickly everywhere else because of the good upload speed from the VPS.\n And the main reason is also that if i change files locally, they can be synced to my nextcloud and vice versa.\n The only way i found would be WebDAV with Cloud Sync. But is that the best and only way?\n I tried also with a vpn connection and mount the nextcloud files folder to the nas and with sftp mount. Then with rsync, but thats not really working like i want to.\n Du you have some ideas?\n Greetings :)\n    submitted by    /u/Bleala  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got it running qBittorrent-nox, Aria2 (following this and this tutorials,with AriaNg frontend served via Apache), and filebrowser/SFTP/Samba for file access. I had some other services running, but I've stopped them for the moment. I've set Aria2 and qBittorrent to download to /media/pi/Downloads, which is the automatic mount point for my 500GB HDD (NTFS, via FUSE)\n Problem: \n It doesn't download torrents. When I add a torrent in qBittorrent web interface, it'll grab the metadata, list tens or hundreds of peers, then I'll watch the download speed drop down from KB/s to bytes/s to zero and stop. The same torrent, when added to the Aria2 web interface, will download slowly (though I have seen the first one I tried download at 4 Mbit/s which is very good for my internet). I'm nervous to stick exclusively with Aria2, however, as, despite downloading the torrents, I can't tell whether it seeds them or not. It goes into \"seeding\" mode, but uploads remain at 0 Kb/s. I need to be able to seed, to use it with a private tracker or two.\n Question:\n Can anyone please help me figure out what's wrong with qBittorrent, why it's not downloading or seeding torrents, and how to fix it? Is Aria2 actually seeding and I just can't see it? Is there any way to tell?\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/neusymar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or will it just add all the info to the \"nextcloud\" photo. (plenty of storage, so not a major issue) -will the photoprism info also show in the nextcloud environment? -is there a android app to browse through my photos or can I only access it via webinterface -does it change file structure (Pictures/2021/2021-01/filename.jpg)\n Ideally all my photos would be indexed/labeled on all devices so a backwards sync option would be great but not sure that is in the scope of all platforms involved. \n Is there a clear instruction to run it without docker?\n    submitted by    /u/seabird1974  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n for some time already I've been working on setting up my all-in-one self-hosted home server that one day should server as my go-to for many things ranging from development to NAS. I'm trying to manage as much as possible from a single repository with Ansible. At the moment I'm at the current state:\n  \nUbuntu Server\n K3s Kubernetes cluster single node\n ZFS Pool with a bunch of HDDs\n SSDs\n bunch of other smaller things\n  \nSo far I have not a single utility running that requires any persistent storage. This obviously has to change. And with that I also have to think about redundancy, backups, restoring, and so on. Doing all this on a plain filesystem would be nothing new to me.\n A few random questions:\n  \nShould I handle backup and snapshots of stuff running in K8s also in K8s? Or do everything on the host OS?\n hostPath volumes? local persistent volumes? longhorn? velero?\n  \nWould be great if you could share your take on this topic.\n    submitted by    /u/trallnag  \n [link]   [comments]",

So he inputs patient name/type of job/date to be delivered into google calendar and that's pretty much it. This might happen a few times with the same piece of work. Every other detail is manually typed in some excel that its only accessible locally. \n Intended workflow:\n Input patient name/type of job/date to be delivered with a tracking number so any dentist can view in which state the job is, possibly with a QR code that could be printed in the labels for each dentist to keep track of how many jobs are done monthly with each one.\n Of course more features can be applied, I was thinking this more as a logistics kind of software rather than a medical one.\n    submitted by    /u/derbignus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, first time posting to this sub. I've spent the last week scouring the interwebs and I haven't found anyone talking about what I'm trying to do. Any help would be very greatly appreciated. \n I'm trying to connect two remote locations together. Both locations have a dynamic IP address. Everything I've seen so far has suggested using a Dynamic DNS service or buying a domain name and using a free Dynamic DNS. Those are great ideas but I know there's got to be a way to do this for free. If it can't be done, then it can't be done, but purely on principle I feel like it's total bullshit that there's no free alternatives that don't rely on the whim of an ISP or third party services. \n This is what I was thinking, neither IP changes all that frequently, maybe once every month or 2. Additionally, it seems very unlikely that both IP's would change at exactly the same time. Would it be possible to run an automatic process at both locations that would constantly update their IP's to one another? \n So we have location A and location B that constantly talk to each other and update the IP address. At location A, the IP address changes. Now, location B doest know the new IP address of location A. Because the two IP's didn't change at the same time, location A still knows the IP address of location B and subsequently can send the updated IP address. \n Anyone know if anything like this exists or have any ideas for free alternatives? \n On a side note, I have an old TPlink Archer A9 that I'm not using, it has a free Built-in ddns with tp-link. I switched over to an edge router. Is there anyway I could put the A9 in a DMZ on the network and have it only for updating the ddns? Could I switch to IPV6?\n Honestly, any free and automated ideas would be perfect.

Now that they've been brought out and will no longer work for non US based users, we can no longer use it.\n Grocy looked like it may fit the bill, but it's a bit too complete. I need the all important spousal-approval factor. Adding a new item in a shopping list required setting the item up first, we just need something to show a checklist really.\n So, TL;DR. I'm looking for something, self hosted that'll allow us to create a list, with the ability to check items off as they're picked up. The list needs to be available to multiple users. Ideally needs a companion Android app, but PWA is perfectly fine too.\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/psybernoid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically I'm looking for a selfhosted Spotify-like solution without the fancy 'I think you will like this music'-suggestions. :)\n I have a self built NAS with all my music on it, a receiver in my living room (Yamaha R-N303D, DLNA/Airplay capable), a RPi with speakers connected to it in my bathroom (running piCorePlayer at the moment), and a bunch of smartphones, tablets etc.\n I am looking for a selfhosted solution that enables me to:\n  \nmaintain my music collection (e.g. scan music into a database, playlist manipulation, etc) using a nice web user interface\n listen to the music using a web browser (using the same nice web user interface), so that I can access my music remotely\n control what is playing on the home appliances in my home (receiver and RPi)\n sync subsets of my music files (certain playlists) to my tablets, smartphones, etc. so that I can listen to it while I'm offline (car, commute on public transportation, etc.)\n  \nThe solutions that I found so far are either good at 1/streaming to a browser, or 2/ streaming to home appliances (for example Airsonic vs. Logitech Media Server).

          "description": "Hey y'all. So this started out as a small project, but it ended up being waaay more complicated than I thought it was going to be. I cracked the screen on my Pixel 4a and I found out it was gonna cost $230 to repair. You know what I can buy for $230? Another phone. I def downgraded, but I don't use my phone for much. So then I had this Pixel 4a that wasn't even a year old that Amazon was going to pay me $20-60 for. \n I really just wanted to wipe it and put Linux on it, but apparently that's not actually a thing I can do like I can with a computer. And 4a isn't ported to Ubuntu Touch yet. So I came across Linux Deploy. I've been needing to setup a backup server anyway.\n ANYWAY, this ended up becoming a whole thing because I had to find a work around for just about everything (because of chroot/Android/aarch64/etc.....). And I did! I even got it working with external storage and LVM!! I posted a tutorial on everything (split into two parts, because it gets hairy and LVM is optional). This is Debian in chroot running UrBackup. This project isn't for everyone, especially because you're limited to EXT4 and it only works with Windows and Linux clients (no Mac).\n But if you have an Android phone sitting around and you need a backup server, you can give it a swing:\n https://www.hannahtech.co/post/turn-your-old-cracked-android-phone-into-a-backup-server-urbackup-linux-deploy-tutorial-part-i\n The biggest con is that you are, at the end of the day, still running Android. You can disable most services and apps, but if you're paranoid about Big Brother Google, this probably isn't for you.\n    submitted by    /u/Significant-Toe3842  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Maybe I could get some type of financiation or ads?)\n ​\n *I have a static public IP\n *Pi2 is the only energy-efficient computer\n *Maybe I could have it 24/7\n *I don’t know anyway to hide my ip \n *I don’t need to be in a search engine, as I can give the address to every class\n *Security is a must for my self hosted idea\n *I can get a SIM card with mobile data and host from there despite not being recommended \n I won’t be hosting big files, just pdfs or images. Most of the contents would be linked to external pages (with permission from the author) Using ads won’t be bad I think (I’m a student so I won’t put ads that could distract people) but the ads should be 100% customisable (size, place And content?)\n Thanks again!

          "description": "Hi guys, it's my first post, so please be gentle. \n I have a domain name called exampledomain.com that I would like to host a website on and ensure it's encrypted etc using SSL. I'm hosting the website on godaddy at the moment.\n I also have another web server at home that I'd like to expose to the internet securely with SSL. I'd like this address to be store.exampledomain.com\n in GoDaddy's DNS, I have an A record for store that points to my router at home.\n When it comes to SSL certificates, I'm confused how to implement this for both websites and more specifically, what type of cert I'll need. Or will I need two certificates? I currently have a SAN cert with up to 5 SAN's from godaddy.\n Generally, you need to submit a CSR to generate the cert from the server the website is on. So I do this on the server where exampledomain.com sits, then upload the CSR to godaddy and voila; I get my cert.\n However, now I want a cert for store.exampledomain.com so I need to go to my server at home hosting the website and generate a CSR for store. Is it just a matter of rekeying the certificate in GoDaddy now? Will that break the existing certificate for exampledomain.com?\n Any resources you could share that might educate me further would be helpful, also.\n So confused, eager to learn.\n    submitted by    /u/BowlersName  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've recently migrated from a custom built mergerfs on ubuntu system to a Synology device. Whether this is an upgrade or not is in question, but I wanted a level of redundancy, a nicer heat solution and something which would just work so I didn't have to worry about storage when selfhosting. \n I've been using NFS for a while, with user accounts stored in AD. Pre-synology it worked great; realm join and we're off and running. NFS with sec=sys worked wonders because each user had the same uid/gid everywhere.\n My primary use cases are 2 docker hosts. I'd mount the nfs share on each host, then each container runs as a set user and only has access to their own directories. It's magic. One mount and the rest takes care of itself.\n In this new synology world, it's not as easy. It generates different uids than everything else on the network so sec=sys doesn't work. I had a stab at nfs idmapping and it doesn't seem to work. Google is a mixed bag but the consensus is this isn't the answer (and may even be a synology quirk).\n The answer seems to be either; \n  \nchmod -R 777\n manage uids manually (ergh...)\n kerberos\n samba\n  \nI'm new to kerberos but I think I'm beginning to slowly get it. Is it worth it? \n Kerberos & Samba also may mean I need to manually mount each share under different user accounts. This feels cleaner but a relative pain in the arse.\n    submitted by    /u/serenitisoon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys. Sorry if this is not the most appropriate subreddit for this type of question, but I feel kinda lost here.\n So, I'm using a RPI4 to self host a discord bot I developed, along with some (micro)services the bot depends on, all running on docker. \n I managed to setup github actions to test, build and deploy the nodejs services on docker hub and everything is working fine. However, I'd like to up the ante a little and accomplish a fully automated deploying system. Right now, after the new docker images are pushed to docker hub, I still need to manually SSH into the RPI and use docker-compose to pull and run the containers again.\n My question is: how can I \"trigger\" my RPI to auto pull the new images (and run the containers again) after gihub actions pushes to docker hub?\n PS: I've heard of watchtower, and while that does work, it's not exactly what I'm looking for. Since it runs on a schedule, it doesn't update the images right after they're pushed to docker hub. Also, I'm aware that docker has put on some limits to pulls/day for free users, so that would make the watchtower rollouts even slower.\n Sorry for the somewhat long post, and thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/seudirce  \n [link]   [comments]",

Documentation is not very good so I decided to ask more experienced self hosters about a few things.\n Is it just gui for browsing ebooks? I cannot find any \"add\" button, so I'm not sure if it is supposed to work similar to regular calibre, or is it just browsing frontend? How can I add new book? Should I also have calibre in parallel, that will use the same database as calibre-web from the mentioned above git repository?\n Second question? Is it possible to host audiobooks with calibre-web?\n    submitted by    /u/lord_EarlGray  \n [link]   [comments]",

Includes the ability to display dependent \"child\" containers, useful to make sure that your app is running if it needs to include a DB etc.\n https://github.com/Inlustra/auto-docker-dash\n It's a little heavy handed and hasn't been tested super-well.
