For example:\n  \nHow do I keep my apps running all the time, even if \n If my Intel NUC gets shut down (like, after a reboot), how do I get all the applications I was running back up again, ideally with zero fuss?\n How do I make sure all the apps I want keep running?\n How do I deploy changes to the apps? Ideally I could do this from my macbook which I use for development, and again with as little fuss as possible. In the best case, I can push a change to my GitHub repo, have a jenkins server running on my NUC run CI/CD tests, then deploy to the NUC.\n Do y'all run Docker or Kubernetes or something to run lots of apps at once?\n Also, is there a chat room or something where I can ask questions in low-latency?

          "description": "A number of years ago I saw a note taking app on someone else's PC which looked like yellow post-its, but each had a name. It would basically function like a post-it shaped wiki with references between notes and aliases for notes.\n If you used another note's name in the text of your note it would automatically hyperlink to it wiki-style. You could also create a new note from text in your current note and that text would always hyperlink to that note. You could also have aliases so various versions of text would link to the same note. \n At least this is what I remember about it, but for the life of me I can't find it again now. It was on a linux machine, but I think it might have had a poor windows port at the time. \n Is there something similar, which would maybe allow the creation of stuff like mind maps, indexes, collate the notes into books, etc., but which can be hosted as a web app? I've looked at a number of apps in the awesome selfhosted list, but, at least from the descriptions, none seem to fit the bill. Tidlywiki seems to come close, but I'm not so sure from what I've tried of it so far.\n PS.

I setup NPM on that Linode Docker in hopes that I could tie my domain.com to that as well and assign subdomains on that server but it's not working and I assume it's because I am already using that domain in the NPM container running on my home server. \n ​\n Currently:\n subdomain1.domain.com points to 192.168.1.100:1234\n subdomain2.domain.com points to 192.168.1.200:1235\n and so on, and so on.\n ​\n I would like to add:\n subdomain3.domain.com points to 75.65.55.45:1234\n    submitted by    /u/fivetwentyseven  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it worth it?\n I assume I will need to configure the server itself, and purchase a number - how is routing handled? What other things will I need to consider? It will be running on a dedicated server hosted by OVH\n Requirements would need to be free/open-sourced or low-cost and maintained. UK numbers, and have the ability to run via a smartphone and/or a desktop PC (softphone)\n If it comes down to it, I will just continue the subscription with Skype\n Any info would be amazing, thank you!\n EDIT: It would be mostly inbound for receiving support calls\n    submitted by    /u/Stellar404  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have some questions, i have done some research, but i figured this would be easier.\n I found navidrome a few weeks ago after dealing with constant nightmares with plex and emby. Not only does navidrome work flawlessly, but it's simple. \n The first question is what is considered the best music server to run in a container on docker? All i really need is artist, albums, genres, playlist, etc. all the basics. Navidrome doesnt have genre as of this moment but i am paired to it via play:sub on ios and it has genres. I am really going to be using navidrome on my phone when i am not home. When i am home i will be using kodi. \n The next question is about photos and videos stored on my nas. I used to use plex for music and for my photos and videos. They destroyed both music and photos and videos. Alot of the time, the videos would not play. I basically want something how plex worked. That has an app i can open and view my pics and videos fast. Right now i am using jellyfin just for my pics and videos, but it's a bit slow. I want the container to only read pics and videos, with no write access. I saw people recommending photo view which i can not install on docker synology. I also saw photoprism, but figured i would post this to what is the best route to go.\n Any other self hosted container recommendations would be great as well ! \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/kritikosxamos  \n [link]   [comments]",

So after much research I have found this service: \n https://bulkgate.com\n They have a great functionality called \"Mobile Connect\" that allows you to essentially start a server on your phone to handle the sending / receiving of messages and then relay that info back to their server / api. \n Realistically this is EXACTLY what I need (especially with their WooSMS plugin) however, sometimes the messages can take nearly 10 minutes to arrive. It's random and has no rhyme or reason as to why it takes longer, so it's difficult to debug. \n I was hoping to discover if a similar service exists or If I can self-host my own gateway like Bulkgate has done to use my cell phone to send messages. \n I have seen this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gsmmodem but have not gotten it to work and truly this would need a significant amount of development from this point. \n Anyone have any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/eternalcold  \n [link]   [comments]",

I made a habit of removing metadata, compressing and encrypting the files so that I know that only I can access them but this became quite time consuming.\n I decided to setup some shell scripts to automate this for myself and I figured other people who are self-hosting or using a public Nextcloud server might be interested too. I wrote a basic guide on the steps I would go through and how this script can automate it to save time if anyone's interested.\n The Mat2 CLI alone is a great addition as it strips all the metadata from you files and it works recursively so it's fairly simple to use.\n Guide: https://articles.eoincoogan.com/protect_data.html\n Git Repo for scripts: https://github.com/CoogyEoin/Cosaint\n    submitted by    /u/esper12345  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been looking at sites like https://docusaurus.io and https://www.bookstackapp.com. \n Am I in the right track? Or are there better ones for my needs?\n Thank you very much for your time reading this and for any responses.\n    submitted by    /u/creamyflir  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are 3 main advantages Google Photos provide:\n 1- Safe and resilient to data loss\n 2- Simple application interface\n 3- Flexible storage\n We are working on a decentralized solution, which is indeed opensource. Solution is based on IPFS, IPLS and proxy re-encryption. Files are stored on an IPFS node, which can be synchronized with as many other nodes as user chooses to keep data safe and resilient to loss. Also data can be encrypted and saved safely on filecoin network or any normal cloud server. The node provides file management and database API through IPLD/IPFS. Developers can develop for end-users using simple-to-use APIs that are provided for each node. User can either install the open-source software on a machine manually to create a \"BOX\" node or purchase a \"BOX\" node.\n ​\n First application we made is a Google Photo replacement, which you can find here:\n functionland/photos (github.com)\n ​\n you can also read more at our website:\n https://fx.land\n I would appreciate any constructive feedback and stay tuned! \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/a9yxrb9vik271.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d0b8e43af3c2c500c2566c297eff53398336d5c\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Jackfruit5814  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: Google thinks some people in US are not in the US, because they also have a personal VPN server at home for their family abroad. Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?\n ​\n DR:\n We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It's very similar to PiVPN.\n About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. \n For example, YouTube music says \"this service is not available in your country\" on the person's phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don't think their families were using any of these services, but can't be sure.\n We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it's always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.\n Does Anyone Else face this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/getwepn  \n [link]   [comments]",

To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. \n VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways.

Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. \n Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header.

I figured it's best I mention my use case so here goes:\n  \nPlex server: I haven't decided on plex as such but seeing as it's the most common, I might start with it. I'm okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I'm only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn't be required, but I've read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I'd like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.\n Smarthome: This is the part that I haven't done any research on so excuse me if something doesn't make sense. From my understanding I'll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I'd like to be able to do this.\n Seedbox: I'm currently seeding about 60TB of \"linux iso's\". This is spread across 20k torrents. I'd want to move all this to the new server.\n File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.\n Security system: Camera's would output and store locally in this server.\n  \nThis is all I can think of for now but I'm pretty sure I'd need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?\n I'm pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones?

I use nginx on the host system to proxy these, one of these containers (seafile) I installed using docker-compose, the others I have not (gitlab had a longish string for installation you needed to use). I didn't publish the ports, but left them default. When I look at posts I see people using lots of other docker containers to monitor/manage/configure their docker containers, and I'm a bit confused. I will be adding more containers for sure, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I'm using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn't going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?\n I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there's a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I'm not opposed to swapping nameservers.\n I'm sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I've spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along.

          "description": "First, I wasn't to clarify -- I'm not wanting DNS to add a specific port. I know that's not supported in the wild.\n If I have multiple devices that utilize the same ports, can a DNS record be used to direct the traffic to the proper device?\n As an example: a service runs on port 123. Three internal LAN devices all use port 123. Can I setup my DNS such that I can route to a specific device and avoid port forwarding?\n foo A 192.168.1.10 bar B 192.168.1.51 yop C 192.168.5.20 \n Thus by requesting foo.example.com:123, it would automatically route to 192.168.1.10:123?and yop.example.com:123 would give 192.168.5.20:123?\n This seems like it should work, but I've been unable to implement it successfully on my DNS Server. Incoming traffic from the internet does not seem to utilize the internal DNS server. Is there a way to make incoming traffic get direction from my internal DNS?\n In fact, it seems like my DNS records do nothing for redirecting incoming traffic.\n    submitted by    /u/schnautz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.\n The solution I'm presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn't put all my brain cells into it)).\n What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)\n You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync\n I'm really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)\n I hope it will be useful to some people.

One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.\n I don't like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I'm being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.\n I'm curious how other people have this set up?\n Does anyone have any suggestions?\n Thanks for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/SluggishDog  \n [link]   [comments]",

While I've got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there's newer tech that is far more convenient. I'm super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) & allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I'm not even aware of! I'm less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.\n ​\n While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh & the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!\n ​\n I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I'm under the impression that the default used to be K8 & Docker & Ansible, but now it seems that K8 & Docker don't play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?\n ​\n Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management.

          "description": "Hi,\n We are using OnlyOffice self hosted but only as groupware email solution - we have around 100 users, and every user has 2-5 external mailboxes connected via imap to external mail server. OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:\n  \nNextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).\n Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.\n Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.\n Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. \n Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don't want to move mx'es to our new self hosted.\n  \nSo, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:\n  \nCreate users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.\n Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.\n Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.\n It's ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.\n  \nMany thanks for any suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/omgte  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have looked at and rejected Mattermost (doesn't have the permissions I need) and Rocket.Chat (has half the permissions but runs too slow). \n What I really need is a chat server that can be used to restrict file uploads to specific rooms or user roles, and, at the very least, has the capability to create an 'arrivals' system, where users show up to a single room before being invited to the chat at large. My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don't want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. \n I'm currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it's unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.\n    submitted by    /u/BaseTurd818  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you haven't used it, Tailscale solves so many problems with connectivity / port forwarding / security. Run it on all your machines and log in, and they're all connected and their hostnames resolve (i.e. http://mycomputer:8080). It solves One Problem, with absolutely zero config headache. I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don't mind that Tailscale isn't fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way\n It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you'd want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)\n I have no association with the project btw, I'm solely an extremely happy free-tier user\n    submitted by    /u/kitanokikori  \n [link]   [comments]",

With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration.

The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",
