          "description": "Hi Self-Hosters, \n I was wondering if anyone is able to recommend a good self-hosted financial management system. Ideally what I'm looking for is:\n  \nHandle multiple Income accounts\n Track multiple savings goals across different bank accounts\n Handle redraw mortgage accounts\n Have a web UI for managing across the local network\n  \nI'm not really fussed about importing transactions directly from my bank, I can enter that manually (and am just about paranoid enough to not trust any service). Currently, I'm using a google spreadsheet to tell me how much I need to add to each account on a fortnightly basis and to record expenditure against those accounts. I don't need to generate invoices.\n Preferring a self-hosted system rather than something I login to over the internet for privacy reasons, and would like something that I can put in a container or a VM so that its accessible on the home network for my wife to be able to access.\n Something simple to use would be a bonus (to keep the wife happy). \n Also I'm not an accountant, so if I haven't explained myself very well please let me know. \n Thanks everyone!\n    submitted by    /u/techlearningcurves  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, a group of friends and I decided we want to play Valheim and I thought it'd be a great idea to host a dedicated server on the VPS using pterodactyl panel.\n Now, I wouldn't say I'm an expert at this. I'm a software developer by trade, but in setting up various things on my VPS I've learned a thing or two over the years.\n But Pterodactyl Panel has defeated me. It is written in PHP. I followed both official documentation and community guides. I asked countless questions on their discord. I am faced by problem after problem, some of which I can't find any help with at all. It's a nightmare. The only solution I see is to either hire a sysadmin to do this for me, or to look for alternatives.\n Anyway, sorry about the rant. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n I've also considered just dumping pterodactyl entirely and just building my own docker images with the servers I need.

I know there are lots of services that can replace some individually (like using NextCloud), but I am looking for what the best options are. One thing that I am really wanting is something similar to iMazing which looks like an amazing product but just a little outside my use case (and if something else will do it for free, all the better).\n What I like about iMazing is that I can backup and manage all of my data (messages, photos, apps, the works) from a remote location with a UI that is very similar to iTunes. I'm trying to set up a family backup of photos and iPhones for my parents and siblings and so having that ease of use is key. The downside of iMazing is that the unlimited plan only lets me have 2 computers with keys so only myself and one other household can manage their devices or I can get lifetime keys for 10 devices but I need more future proofing because we will have more iPhones in the family inevitably. \n What is your setup for iOS backup and management for your home setups and specifically what is your ideal photo backup setup that you use for those people who aren't tech savvy (i.e parents/siblings).\n    submitted by    /u/wmsmckay  \n [link]   [comments]",

For instance, if i am using node red and i put a tp link kasa node, it finds nothing. If i were to run node red on my raspberry pi and apply the same node it finds all my lan tp link smart plugs. Besides adding the containers to a macvlan on the synology nas, is there any other way to get around this issue? I created a macvlan, but now the issue is whenever i connect to my home vpn (it runs on the same nas as docker) i can not access those ips on the macvlan.\n ​\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/kritikosxamos  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, first time posting to this sub. I've spent the last week scouring the interwebs and I haven't found anyone talking about what I'm trying to do. Any help would be very greatly appreciated. \n I'm trying to connect two remote locations together. Both locations have a dynamic IP address. Everything I've seen so far has suggested using a Dynamic DNS service or buying a domain name and using a free Dynamic DNS. Those are great ideas but I know there's got to be a way to do this for free. If it can't be done, then it can't be done, but purely on principle I feel like it's total bullshit that there's no free alternatives that don't rely on the whim of an ISP or third party services. \n This is what I was thinking, neither IP changes all that frequently, maybe once every month or 2. Additionally, it seems very unlikely that both IP's would change at exactly the same time. Would it be possible to run an automatic process at both locations that would constantly update their IP's to one another? \n So we have location A and location B that constantly talk to each other and update the IP address. At location A, the IP address changes. Now, location B doest know the new IP address of location A. Because the two IP's didn't change at the same time, location A still knows the IP address of location B and subsequently can send the updated IP address. \n Anyone know if anything like this exists or have any ideas for free alternatives? \n On a side note, I have an old TPlink Archer A9 that I'm not using, it has a free Built-in ddns with tp-link. I switched over to an edge router. Is there anyway I could put the A9 in a DMZ on the network and have it only for updating the ddns? Could I switch to IPV6?\n Honestly, any free and automated ideas would be perfect. Would love to hear what you guys and gals think!\n Thanks again\n    submitted by    /u/chooseausername69251  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd rather prefer to just have a bunch of folders with md/png/svg/yaml files 😆 \n At the moment, I'm considering deploying a local Gitlab instance, it does all I need but the WYSIWYG editing.\n Would you have any suggestions? Likely, I skipped some obvious choices for you (say, e.g., perhaps WordPress does the job!), so please feel free to share any inputs, they'll be very appreciated.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/3x35r22m4u  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd like to set things up so that three small JAMStack-based (Gatsby and Hexo) websites I have could be built and deployed from my NAS instead of github actions.\n However, my knowledge of self-hosted build systems is very old (circa 2008). Does anyone have any suggestions for an environment that is working well for you? Currently the code for the sites is hosted on github and deployed to (very) inexpensive hosting via FTP, although that's subject to change as I bring more stuff back to the home network.\n    submitted by    /u/williamwgant  \n [link]   [comments]",

I cannot build a server at home, I need to do it in the Cloud.\n I'm thinking about renting a dedicated server at Hetzner. I can rent it Germany for 47 euros a month, but in Finland it costs 41 euros a month. \n I think it is a lot of money but I think I'm able to do it and I really like all the things I can do if I have a dedicated server. \n ​\n Now, I have used iperf to test the internet connection. When my PC is the client I get about 10Mbit per second (my upload speed at home) with both servers in Germany and Finland. If my PC is the server, and I try iperf on a server in Germany as client I get 75Mbit per second (my download speed at home). If I try the server in Finland as client I get about 60Mbit per second, about 20% less when trying from Germany.\n The ping is 20ms to Germany but 40ms to Finland.\n ​\n I want to host things like, OpenVPN, PiHole, Bitwarden and much more on dedicated server. Basically I want to connect to the VPN server all the time, when I am at home or traveling or work. \n Should I go with more expensive but closer internet connection or less expensive but a bit slower internet connection?\n I would like to go with the cheapest. Since I'm the only user on the dedicated server anyway.

          "description": "Hey y'all. So this started out as a small project, but it ended up being waaay more complicated than I thought it was going to be. I cracked the screen on my Pixel 4a and I found out it was gonna cost $230 to repair. You know what I can buy for $230? Another phone. I def downgraded, but I don't use my phone for much. So then I had this Pixel 4a that wasn't even a year old that Amazon was going to pay me $20-60 for. \n I really just wanted to wipe it and put Linux on it, but apparently that's not actually a thing I can do like I can with a computer. And 4a isn't ported to Ubuntu Touch yet. So I came across Linux Deploy. I've been needing to setup a backup server anyway.\n ANYWAY, this ended up becoming a whole thing because I had to find a work around for just about everything (because of chroot/Android/aarch64/etc.....). And I did! I even got it working with external storage and LVM!! I posted a tutorial on everything (split into two parts, because it gets hairy and LVM is optional). This is Debian in chroot running UrBackup. This project isn't for everyone, especially because you're limited to EXT4 and it only works with Windows and Linux clients (no Mac).\n But if you have an Android phone sitting around and you need a backup server, you can give it a swing:\n https://www.hannahtech.co/post/turn-your-old-cracked-android-phone-into-a-backup-server-urbackup-linux-deploy-tutorial-part-i\n The biggest con is that you are, at the end of the day, still running Android. You can disable most services and apps, but if you're paranoid about Big Brother Google, this probably isn't for you.\n    submitted by    /u/Significant-Toe3842  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm hosting the website on godaddy at the moment.\n I also have another web server at home that I'd like to expose to the internet securely with SSL. I'd like this address to be store.exampledomain.com\n in GoDaddy's DNS, I have an A record for store that points to my router at home.\n When it comes to SSL certificates, I'm confused how to implement this for both websites and more specifically, what type of cert I'll need. Or will I need two certificates? I currently have a SAN cert with up to 5 SAN's from godaddy.\n Generally, you need to submit a CSR to generate the cert from the server the website is on. So I do this on the server where exampledomain.com sits, then upload the CSR to godaddy and voila; I get my cert.\n However, now I want a cert for store.exampledomain.com so I need to go to my server at home hosting the website and generate a CSR for store. Is it just a matter of rekeying the certificate in GoDaddy now? Will that break the existing certificate for exampledomain.com?\n Any resources you could share that might educate me further would be helpful, also.\n So confused, eager to learn.\n    submitted by    /u/BowlersName  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whether this is an upgrade or not is in question, but I wanted a level of redundancy, a nicer heat solution and something which would just work so I didn't have to worry about storage when selfhosting. \n I've been using NFS for a while, with user accounts stored in AD. Pre-synology it worked great; realm join and we're off and running. NFS with sec=sys worked wonders because each user had the same uid/gid everywhere.\n My primary use cases are 2 docker hosts. I'd mount the nfs share on each host, then each container runs as a set user and only has access to their own directories. It's magic. One mount and the rest takes care of itself.\n In this new synology world, it's not as easy. It generates different uids than everything else on the network so sec=sys doesn't work. I had a stab at nfs idmapping and it doesn't seem to work. Google is a mixed bag but the consensus is this isn't the answer (and may even be a synology quirk).\n The answer seems to be either; \n  \nchmod -R 777\n manage uids manually (ergh...)\n kerberos\n samba\n  \nI'm new to kerberos but I think I'm beginning to slowly get it.

Sorry if this is not the most appropriate subreddit for this type of question, but I feel kinda lost here.\n So, I'm using a RPI4 to self host a discord bot I developed, along with some (micro)services the bot depends on, all running on docker. \n I managed to setup github actions to test, build and deploy the nodejs services on docker hub and everything is working fine. However, I'd like to up the ante a little and accomplish a fully automated deploying system. Right now, after the new docker images are pushed to docker hub, I still need to manually SSH into the RPI and use docker-compose to pull and run the containers again.\n My question is: how can I \"trigger\" my RPI to auto pull the new images (and run the containers again) after gihub actions pushes to docker hub?\n PS: I've heard of watchtower, and while that does work, it's not exactly what I'm looking for. Since it runs on a schedule, it doesn't update the images right after they're pushed to docker hub. Also, I'm aware that docker has put on some limits to pulls/day for free users, so that would make the watchtower rollouts even slower.\n Sorry for the somewhat long post, and thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/seudirce  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately I’m here with a dumb question instead regarding self hosting my apps.\n Let’s say my docker container is running all my apps and is on 192.169.1.1 It’s my understanding that the only way to expose these services outside my network is by forwarding port 80 to that IP in my router settings, correct? Is there any other way? I ask because I don’t want to do this, and just want a little piece of mind after all this tinkering. \n I can’t access them from outside my network that I know of, however, I’m running ssl on all of them so technically am I not exposing them somewhat by navigating to something like photoprism.mydomain.com?\n Thanks for any help,\n    submitted by    /u/Roux85  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need to maintain an offsite backup copy (I have a synology ds1515+ and a ds713+ with ds513 that makes it the same size as the ds1515+ for local backups) and am happy to use a VPS for snapshots etc in case of ransomware. \n My primary need is to scan to PDF and have those PDFs OCR’d and indexed so I can easily find and print anything I need. Add to that things like PDF downloads such as MagPI and HackSpace magazines and manuals for everything I own and it becomes a complete repository with no need for a nay paper files. \n Do you do anything like this for your documents and what do you recommend?\n    submitted by    /u/dhardyuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example to get to nextcloud I do:\n 192.168.10.5:100\n for monica I use:\n 192.168.10.5:105\n For heimdall I use\n 192.168.10.5:80\n etc. same private IP, different port.\n ​\n I therefore need to use reverse proxy for all theses ports and use self signed certificates to get SSL. I am not interested in using letsencrypt, some DNS redirect etc. I want my setup as it is now but with HTTPS. So far when using nginx proxy manager I can get it to work on one service at a time, on port 80 only. I want to use it to listen to multiple different ports.

How to I use multiple ports with nginx proxy manager? I am using docker for everything\n    submitted by    /u/SugMinVitaKuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm new to all of this and the definitions of words and concepts are overwhelming. So when I googled \"on-premises\" sometimes it's required to have your server in your home/organisation but sometimes it's still\" on-prem\" if you rent a server as long as you're the one in charge over the software and the provider does not give you software and server as a whole.\n So if renting a server is allowed and running your bought software on it, isn't that IaaS? And if it really is IaaS, it would make no sense to say \"on-premises vs. cloud\" because IaaS is also a part of Cloud Computing. It seems to me that often cloud and SaaS are used synonymous.\n In addition, sometimes I read \"on-premises software (self-hosting)\" as it was the same. But for me, having your own server (rented or bought) is somewhat your \"own cloud\" at home. And that would contratdict the whole \"on-premise vs. cloud\" thing. But maybe this is a false understanding of the concept and for the last point, I see why \"own cloud at home\" is more a metaphor when acknowledging that Cloud Computing is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS and it's somehow weird to offer a service to oneself :-) \n Thanks for reading\n    submitted by    /u/skippydi34  \n [link]   [comments]",

My google-fu has failed me, or maybe I'm being impatient to find the right tutorial. \n I'm looking to pull off, something as easy as:\n homeassistant.local\n sab.local\n smokeping.localdomain. \n octoprint\n unfi.localdomain\n omv.localdomain \n portianer.local\n ​\n then I want to configure some sort of easy home page like homer that my wife and I can easily find.

          "description": "So I am a developer who has a vps for some basic stuff, but I guess this is not that important for this question. Scrolling through this sub I see some awesome things that would make life a lot easier, however I can't find a lot about the setup people use (config wise, not hardware). This sub has some awesome posts like what people use, what they've learned, how they failed, etc, but I'm more curious to how you've setup your server and what you like / dislike about the setup.\n For example, I'm planning to start self hosting and redo my vps setup in the following way:\n Ubuntu with docker, openssh, ufw and fail2ban, as I'm already familiar with this and it keeps it easy to what I've installed directly on Ubuntu itself. Then use Portainer with nginx reverse proxy to setup all the various services like NextCloud, wiki, etc. Probably setup 2 database instances (prod/dev) in case something breaks and so I can start fixing it without hurting production. Lastly, add something to back up the docker containers and config to an external party, just don't know which one yet. \n What I like so far: - Little directly installed on Ubuntu itself so updates are easy and I can quickly see if the problem is with docker, the service or Ubuntu - Server wise it's a bit easier to make it secure with only a few things running on Ubuntu itself - Docker itself, just nice to have everything running in containers\n What I don't like / not sure of: - Pure my config, but current setup has 1 DB for all services - I've heard that securing and updating docker containers are an absolute nightmare (I'm pretty new to docker so not sure) - Everything is running on docker, so if docker fails all fails - For all new services I'll use I have to export and import the config in the dev database (or the other way around)\n So how did you guys set up your server and what do you like and dislike about it? Maybe share your experiences so far with different setups so new (rookie) members can learn :)\n    submitted by    /u/dwarf-666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I run my homelab on a Proxmox machine. I have several LXC containers and a couple virtual machines, each running a single service. So far, everything is attached to the same bridge vmbr0, which is attached to the physical network card. Since I am getting a new drive, I wanted to reinstall my homelab and restructure its network, putting each service (or group of services) in its own network, so that they are properly isolated from each other and communication between them can be regulated by the firewall.\n The standard approach seems to be to make a series of bridges vmbrX, one for each network, and to create a virtual machine running pfSense or OPNSense managing such bridges, handling all the routing between them and vmbr0. I was wondering, however, if there is a way to do this without the additional virtual machine. Could Proxmox itself handle the routing in place of OPNSense? There are firewall settings, and there are multiple network settings (vlan, bridges, bonds), but I am not too familiar with the topic.\n Is there any good example of this setup, or do you have any advice?\n Notes:\n  \n I do not want to use NAT. Ideally, I want my local network to be something like 172.16.0.0 and each service to be on something like 172.16.X.0, where the entire subnet can be reached from my local network (barring firewall, of course).\n  \n   submitted by    /u/class_two_perversion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have successfully installed Raid 50 and the install drive is a 500gb Drive seperate from the Raid 50.\n The first issue is setting up the Raid 50 for the VM and sharing it as an internal Drive. I dont care if its not C:\\ but i need it to have a drive letter. I got the Raid 50 to show up once as Drive D:\\ but it went away after a couple of minutes. Now it wont allow me to connect the Windows Server 2019 to Windows 10 VM through the ISCSI Initator. Ive tried to initialize the ISCSI device that was created in Server Management ----> Files and Storage Server -------> ISCSI\n But it always says cannot connected PC on both Windows Server 2019 and the Windows 10 Hyper-V VM.\n ​\n Ive also tried a share drive and an ISCSI and a server pool both fixed and dynamic. Ive tried rebootingt he VM and the HP Proliant DL180 G6\n I've copied the IQN, IP Adress from the Host Server 2019 Computer to Windows 10 VM and vice versa in ISCSI Initiator and i always get cannot connect to PC on both. Ive also tried to find a target and it wont allow me to add it. I have no idea what to do now. The storage pool is empty and i would prefer a fixed volume for faster transfer rates. I cant find the answer anywhere. Thank you ahead of time for all comments.\n ​\n ​\n 2ND Issue:\n I Have a Nvidia Server graphics card. It doesn need a 6pin i have already installed the 16x rise.

I can protect the web UI for that container with authelia without much trouble, but how do I make paperless aware that I am logged in? Do I disable the paperless login mechanism to it auto logs in a user? (this seems dangerous).

It's pretty opinionated (all users in the same OU, all groups in the same OU, limited query-only capabilities and so on) but should be sufficient for 90% of LDAP use cases, and has a *much* simpler deployment and management story than any full LDAP-based system.\n It's written in Rust to have minimal memory requirements, and the data is stored in SQL for simple backups. It would be absolutely trivial to wrap in a Docker container.\n If you are interested in contributing, check out https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap!

It is also privacy friendly without any trackers.\n This web app is not (yet) as polished as Google Maps app but there are many projects that use the routing functionality of GraphHopper and offer \"complete\" apps like outdoor apps (komoot, trailrouter, ride with GPS, Locus Map, plotaroute, Kurviger) or other services (delivery hero, deutsche bahn, GLS, ...)\n And GraphHopper can be used for more things beyond routing like for reachability analysis:\n Reachability analysis across an entire country\n Make sure you follow our twitter or blog posts.

So I searched online for a guide on how to install this on my NAS and found this guide: https://mariushosting.com/how-to-install-freshrss-on-your-synology-nas/\n This guide explains really well how to install FreshRSS into docker but it ends there.\n So far so good followed the guide and got everything to work, installed the FeedMe app on my android phone and got my own RSS feed. Only to find out that it does not automatically refresh my feed. I have to push the actualize button myself everytime which is obviously not what I want to do. Ideally I want it to automatically refresh every X minutes.\n So the beginner I am tried searching for solutions, which I found but got none to work. On the FreshRSS website it self it states I have to do something with the ./app/actualize_script.php but the fun thing is with the guide I used mentioned above I got none of those things. Don't have the app folder nor have I the script they are talking about. The only folders I have are crontabs, keys, log, nginx, php and www. And inside those folders there is also nothing to find they are talking about.\n So for a summary I have FreshRSS running atm in a docker container on my Synology NAS which is working but only need a solution for how to automatically refresh my feed every X minutes or so.\n Does some of you have experience with this and can help a starting self hoster out?\n Thanks in advance!\n Edit: Not Refresh but FreshRSS thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Royalshadex91  \n [link]   [comments]",

The magic of Fedora CoreOS is that it configures itself at install time, including installing Portainer and enabling the host firewall. Once configured, you can quickly and repeatedly set up this server without logging into it. Then you can use Portainer to run any container or docker-compose file like WordPress. By firewalling Portainer you protect your admin interface from possible attacks while leaving the services rendered by your other containers accessible.\n    submitted by    /u/DiHannay  \n [link]   [comments]",

This post (instagram link FYI) in particular rang alarm bells in my head this morning.\n Ive been meaning to trial hosting a PiHole instance on my Unraid server at home for the last few months and I think I just got the push I needed to take the plunge and give it a shot. From what I understand (I've done 0 reading of documentation so far) you host it, set up your preferences and then point all your devices to it as a DNS. I assume I could just set that on my Router and it would auto push that setting to all my devices inside my LAN through DHCP at the point of next timeout, or just clear the table and let it do its thing.\n My question is that assuming all the above is correct, if not a little oversimplified, I could probably also tunnel all my devices that are outside of my LAN through Wireguard and route them through my home internet connection as well, thereby benefiting from PiHole while outside of my LAN, right? Has anyone else attempted a similar thing? My home internet connection isn't blazing fast but it doesn't have a data cap. If this is something thats doable I would seriously consider upgrading my connection if it required it.\n Side note: I also realize that PiHole isn't some magic bullet that stops all this tracking garbage in its tracks but it can significantly reduce how many ads make it to my screens which is a step forwards for me.\n    submitted by    /u/sutekhxaos  \n [link]   [comments]",

I initially started this as a hobby, but I've found myself getting more into it, and using OMV on a practical level.

I run regular backups of my phone and PC, and am looking into the possibility of backup up all of my photos there too (thanks Google).\n I want to add more storage and at least one other drive for backup/redundancy. Before I start spending money and building out, I wanted some thoughts opinions on how to go about this...\n I'm currently satisfied with the Raspberry Pi running OMV, is there any need to buy a full NAS? What are your thoughts about just buying a 4-bay external hard drive enclosure and adding drives? The 8TB I currently have is an external drive from Costco. Can I just get away with buying another one of those? If I get a multi-bay external enclosure, could upgrade to a more powerful server in the future?\n I'm stuck at the moment, as I don't know which way is the best to go. I'm looking for best bang for the buck while keep some flexibility to upgrade (storage and performance) in the future. \n Sorry for my scattered thoughts.

Maybe there's a plugin for it that I haven't found yet. \n Any ideas or suggestions are much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/bmcgonag  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all. I feel like I am very close to getting things running, but I have a couple of issues. When I go to my domains section of mailcow admin and click DNS, this is the information in the modal:\n https://i.imgur.com/1UJLY5l.png\n So issue #1 is that I think the server is expecting/listening for the the wrong public IP. I have tried to look everywhere to change this setting, but I failed 😞. Does this mismatch matter? If so where do I change/hardcode this?\n Issue #2 is smaller, but I can't figure out how to make the TSLA certificate be \"Connection refused\" instead of the actual hash of the certificate... \n Also ports 80 and 443 for my mail.domain.tld go to a reverse proxy server and then to mailcow, whereas the mail ports go to mailcow directly from the router. My inbound and outbound port 25 is blocked by ISP. With the port checking tool, I am able to verify that all other mail ports on my public IP are listening. \n The TSLA issue I guess is an optional setting, but I think the mismatch in the IPs are not allowing the mail server to listen properly, resulting in bounces: \n https://i.imgur.com/EYx5Usc.png\n Not sure if the PTR record matters all too much either, if it does I can see about getting it modified. For the record, I'll probably be sending out through a relay, but I need to be able to receive on my own. If not, are there good options that can forward all mail to me?\n I also have a VPS which I guess I can tunnel to and set up all my DNS records to go there. If I forward all the mail ports from the VPS to mailcow, would that work? Man, I'm not looking forward to getting the iptables setup for dockerized mailcow to use a wireguard interface for wan. But I guess I saw the iptables config in some file so I could potentially just modify that. I don't know, I rather go through my public IP route... \n If someone can help me out, I'd greatly appreciate it! Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/numerica  \n [link]   [comments]",

This server does not need to fit into a rack but will be on 24/7.\n  \nNextcloud (Family use so under 5 users, but used for file backups and sync)\n PhotoPrism (Family use so under 5 users, but used for image backups and sync)\n Jellyfin (Family use so under 5 users, but almost never streaming at the same time)\n Custom apps (Apps that I make, almost no resource use, just things that need to be run on an always on server)\n Plus a little room to expand in case I want to host something new\n  \nHere is a link to what I’m thinking of getting on PC part picker: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/CcY3p2\n Nextcloud says it needs ~ 8 GB of ram and ~ 6 cores for 25 users so I expect to be using ~ 4 GB ram and ~ 3 cores. PhotoPrism says it needs ~ 4 GB of ram and ~ 2 cores but also says “Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should match the number of cores. ” Jellyfin has people saying it works fine with ~2 GB of ram and I expect it to use less than 2 cores And my custom apps should use way less than 2 GB of ram and less than 2 cores\n I didn’t think I needed a graphics card as 1) they are incredibly high in price rn and 2) I didn’t think any of my hosted apps would take advantage of it. Do you see a problem with this?\n Also, I’m having a problem choosing my storage. I want fast storage but with my budget (Preferably less than $700) and my internet connection (Around 100 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up), I’m not sure that I would see a difference between an HDD vs M.2 SSD. Do you have any recommendations on this?\n As a side note, I have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse laying around that I can use for this build, and am planning on putting a Linux distro on it.\n Do you see any problems with my build?

My basic idea was to stop all of them -> backing up the compose files, config + volumes and then restart. But how can I do that? \n The idea was to use labels for the containers to know which should be backed up. I can get them without a problem via bash. After that I just wanted to start them again. But how do I do that? A simple docker start \"container\" is not enough because this would not start other containers which are the base for some services. So I have to use docker-compose up -d to start them again. But for this I need to get the path to the docker-compose file.

          "description": "Hi, I have previously deployed wireguard using the linuxserver/wireguard docker image, and it was easy to set up with the objective of reaching my home server while away.\n Now, I'm looking to set up a vpn to connect some servers in the cloud into a subnet, without actually using the main wg server as a gateway (to avoid pinging traffic back and forth) - what I'm looking to achieve is to have different server computers accessible via a VPN network only, without proxying the traffic (ie clients use their respective gateways). Is this possible with wg? How should I set this up?\n I'm unsure as to how to set this up using docker. Nor do I have much experience with the 'ip' or networking packages. How would one set this up using docker? What prerequisite knowledge is important for a successful implementation here?\n I have read the official docs but was not able to see how to achieve the gateway criteria, and also did not have full understanding of the underlying 'ip' commands. Happy to get pointed to the right resources to achieve this.\n    submitted by    /u/ApocalypseAce  \n [link]   [comments]",

You could also create a new note from text in your current note and that text would always hyperlink to that note. You could also have aliases so various versions of text would link to the same note. \n At least this is what I remember about it, but for the life of me I can't find it again now.

I started to use Google photo to store unlimited pictures so I thought if Google have all of my pictures and data about me let it be useful and use it everywhere. Since Google photo is not unlimited anymore I want to self host my own stuff like a pi hole, a Nas, a domotic assistant, a node express test server etc. \n So my question for you is, where to start. I see that a lot of you are hosting many things. Are you using one or many raspberry pi, are you using more powerful . I want to be able to add a \"module\"(self hosted server) one by one without breaking everything, so I can make the transition smoother.\n Note that I don't want to get rid of Google but I don't want to depend on it \n Sorry if someone already explained it on a post, thanks you for helping me.\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Shinbly  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not only does navidrome work flawlessly, but it's simple. \n The first question is what is considered the best music server to run in a container on docker? All i really need is artist, albums, genres, playlist, etc. all the basics. Navidrome doesnt have genre as of this moment but i am paired to it via play:sub on ios and it has genres. I am really going to be using navidrome on my phone when i am not home. When i am home i will be using kodi. \n The next question is about photos and videos stored on my nas. I used to use plex for music and for my photos and videos. They destroyed both music and photos and videos. Alot of the time, the videos would not play. I basically want something how plex worked. That has an app i can open and view my pics and videos fast. Right now i am using jellyfin just for my pics and videos, but it's a bit slow. I want the container to only read pics and videos, with no write access. I saw people recommending photo view which i can not install on docker synology.

It's random and has no rhyme or reason as to why it takes longer, so it's difficult to debug. \n I was hoping to discover if a similar service exists or If I can self-host my own gateway like Bulkgate has done to use my cell phone to send messages. \n I have seen this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gsmmodem but have not gotten it to work and truly this would need a significant amount of development from this point. \n Anyone have any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/eternalcold  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So for the past while I've been attempting to secure my files the best I can on my server. I know that files and data on enterprise cloud servers are encrypted (or at least I hope they are) and so I've tried to implement this just using GPG. I'm currently hosting my own Nextcloud instance but before that I was using one of the public servers that offer a certain amount of storage for free. I made a habit of removing metadata, compressing and encrypting the files so that I know that only I can access them but this became quite time consuming.\n I decided to setup some shell scripts to automate this for myself and I figured other people who are self-hosting or using a public Nextcloud server might be interested too. I wrote a basic guide on the steps I would go through and how this script can automate it to save time if anyone's interested.\n The Mat2 CLI alone is a great addition as it strips all the metadata from you files and it works recursively so it's fairly simple to use.\n Guide: https://articles.eoincoogan.com/protect_data.html\n Git Repo for scripts: https://github.com/CoogyEoin/Cosaint\n    submitted by    /u/esper12345  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are 3 main advantages Google Photos provide:\n 1- Safe and resilient to data loss\n 2- Simple application interface\n 3- Flexible storage\n We are working on a decentralized solution, which is indeed opensource. Solution is based on IPFS, IPLS and proxy re-encryption. Files are stored on an IPFS node, which can be synchronized with as many other nodes as user chooses to keep data safe and resilient to loss. Also data can be encrypted and saved safely on filecoin network or any normal cloud server. The node provides file management and database API through IPLD/IPFS. Developers can develop for end-users using simple-to-use APIs that are provided for each node. User can either install the open-source software on a machine manually to create a \"BOX\" node or purchase a \"BOX\" node.\n ​\n First application we made is a Google Photo replacement, which you can find here:\n functionland/photos (github.com)\n ​\n you can also read more at our website:\n https://fx.land\n I would appreciate any constructive feedback and stay tuned! \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/a9yxrb9vik271.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d0b8e43af3c2c500c2566c297eff53398336d5c\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Jackfruit5814  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want this website to be as fast as possible for users who will be contributing and revising articles.\n I'm torn between using Digital Ocean's NVME droplet which the closest servers are in San Francisco, or Linode which only has SSD, but it's closest location is in Dallas. I also feel that since this is for a specific location in TX, having a TX-based location would be appreciated by users.\n So the question is: Is storage speed faster than server location? \n I currently have several DO $5 droplets, one of which is running my personal websites. I'm happy with the service which, but that's just for me as I'm the lone admin.\n This new website is a separate venture. I expect several dozen users to be editing the site at the same time, and would like it to be very interactive and as instantaneous as possible. I plan on starting with the lowest tier options and upgrading as needed.\n Both companies offer a $100 credit for the first two months. I've considered launching both to test, but I really don't want to spend that time testing the speed, and would rather spend time with more developing and getting the site ready for it's initial launch.\n Any thoughts on this would be super helpful.\n    submitted by    /u/cinemafunk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: Google thinks some people in US are not in the US, because they also have a personal VPN server at home for their family abroad. Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?\n ​\n DR:\n We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It's very similar to PiVPN.\n About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. \n For example, YouTube music says \"this service is not available in your country\" on the person's phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don't think their families were using any of these services, but can't be sure.\n We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it's always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.\n Does Anyone Else face this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/getwepn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the NordVPN apps there is a type of connection called Obfuscated Server which is meant to conceal the fact that you're using a VPN from endpoints that you visit. This is the relevant bit from the link:\n  \nObfuscated servers are used to bypass VPN-blocking firewalls. To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. \n VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways. For example, data packets can be hidden using additional SSL/SSH encryption so that all the VPN metadata is out of sight. Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. \n Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header. This way, it looks like regular HTTPS traffic filled with meaningless information. Firewalls can’t recognize it, so they let it pass.\n  \nQuestion is: How can I implement this from my home server?\n    submitted by    /u/Teenager69420  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey there. I'm new to self hosting and have spent the last few days doing some research, however I still have a lot of stuff I couldn't figure out. I figured it's best I mention my use case so here goes:\n  \nPlex server: I haven't decided on plex as such but seeing as it's the most common, I might start with it. I'm okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I'm only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn't be required, but I've read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I'd like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.\n Smarthome: This is the part that I haven't done any research on so excuse me if something doesn't make sense. From my understanding I'll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I'd like to be able to do this.\n Seedbox: I'm currently seeding about 60TB of \"linux iso's\". This is spread across 20k torrents. I'd want to move all this to the new server.\n File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.\n Security system: Camera's would output and store locally in this server.\n  \nThis is all I can think of for now but I'm pretty sure I'd need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?\n I'm pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones? I'd ideally want to run all this off a single synology nas but I don't know if that's possible.\n Oh and it's also worth mentioning that I live in a studio apartment so I wouldn't want a noisy server. That pretty much eliminates most Xeons.\n    submitted by    /u/Lumpy-Hedgehog-1479  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use nginx on the host system to proxy these, one of these containers (seafile) I installed using docker-compose, the others I have not (gitlab had a longish string for installation you needed to use). I didn't publish the ports, but left them default. When I look at posts I see people using lots of other docker containers to monitor/manage/configure their docker containers, and I'm a bit confused. I will be adding more containers for sure, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I'm using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn't going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?\n I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there's a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I'm not opposed to swapping nameservers.\n I'm sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I've spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along.

Three internal LAN devices all use port 123. Can I setup my DNS such that I can route to a specific device and avoid port forwarding?\n foo A 192.168.1.10 bar B 192.168.1.51 yop C 192.168.5.20 \n Thus by requesting foo.example.com:123, it would automatically route to 192.168.1.10:123?and yop.example.com:123 would give 192.168.5.20:123?\n This seems like it should work, but I've been unable to implement it successfully on my DNS Server.

Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.\n The solution I'm presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn't put all my brain cells into it)).\n What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)\n You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync\n I'm really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)\n I hope it will be useful to some people.

Media can then be accessed by any device with a web browser.\n The app supports videos (scenes), actors/actresses, movies, studios (including substudios, networks), images and scene chapters (markers).

Also it does not look like there is a way to number of photo shown, it is a fixed number.\n I do not want to use static page generators since I need this stuff to be generated on demand, static page gens are useless in this case.\n thanks\n    submitted by    /u/lenjioereh  \n [link]   [comments]",
