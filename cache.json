          "description": "Anyone know of any good, open source solutions for a DNS server which has a nice, decent, intuitive WebUI for DNS management? Something similar to the way CloudFlare works? Ive been meaning to testout DNS Manager from ISP manager . Windows doesn't have an HTML version of DNS server yet does it? (I know said open source but just curious).\n Alternatively, and maybe I'm misunderstanding this, but maybe an IPAM solution would be good too. Is IPAM where I manage my IPs/DHCP and DNS all in one? I always find it tedious and annoying AF to have to make a static DHCP reservation and then create a second DNS record with the ZeroShell Router i have. Would be sweet to have it all bundled together since IP address management and DNS are so tied together at the end of the day,\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ryanisflying  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would be nice to help increase the spotty coverage in my area but I would also like a raw radar view of the data with no filtering of any aircraft. Is this possible?\n Either way what is the best radar view software to use for this kinda application? \n I have an RTL-SDR (one of those USB TV stick things) and would like to pass it through to a VM in ESXi (if possible).

          "description": "Hello,\n I'm new to all of this and the definitions of words and concepts are overwhelming. So when I googled \"on-premises\" sometimes it's required to have your server in your home/organisation but sometimes it's still\" on-prem\" if you rent a server as long as you're the one in charge over the software and the provider does not give you software and server as a whole.\n So if renting a server is allowed and running your bought software on it, isn't that IaaS? And if it really is IaaS, it would make no sense to say \"on-premises vs. cloud\" because IaaS is also a part of Cloud Computing. It seems to me that often cloud and SaaS are used synonymous.\n In addition, sometimes I read \"on-premises software (self-hosting)\" as it was the same. But for me, having your own server (rented or bought) is somewhat your \"own cloud\" at home. And that would contratdict the whole \"on-premise vs. cloud\" thing. But maybe this is a false understanding of the concept and for the last point, I see why \"own cloud at home\" is more a metaphor when acknowledging that Cloud Computing is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS and it's somehow weird to offer a service to oneself :-) \n Thanks for reading\n    submitted by    /u/skippydi34  \n [link]   [comments]",

It should fulfil all requirements and I want to be able to have control over the data, but it should also be sitting on a modern platform, so I won't have to move everything again soon.Whilst access to compute resources won't be an issue (we're a software company), ease of use is: Right now we don't have any admin staff (yet).

I have spent the morning looking over many videos and different ways of doing it, but it seems that most of them want you to have your sites remotely accessible. In my case, I want a simple method of accessing all my services without remembering what ports and addressing they would be on. I know that MDNS does a lot of it. But it's no good for nested services with ports. I've started to dive into the SWAG documentation. I'm not sure if ngix manager or swag would be a better fit. My google-fu has failed me, or maybe I'm being impatient to find the right tutorial. \n I'm looking to pull off, something as easy as:\n homeassistant.local\n sab.local\n smokeping.localdomain. \n octoprint\n unfi.localdomain\n omv.localdomain \n portianer.local\n ​\n then I want to configure some sort of easy home page like homer that my wife and I can easily find.

Our main goal is a fully open-source system so that it can be r/selfhosted without any hidden parts.\n Shortly on main points from the roadmap:\n - Peer management with a UI dashboard so that you don't need to add peers manually\n - Automatic network changes provisioning so that every peer in the system has the latest state (and newly added peers)\n - Windows support\n - ACLs\n - Mobile clients\n We are a team of two and are looking for some help :).

Scrolling through this sub I see some awesome things that would make life a lot easier, however I can't find a lot about the setup people use (config wise, not hardware). This sub has some awesome posts like what people use, what they've learned, how they failed, etc, but I'm more curious to how you've setup your server and what you like / dislike about the setup.\n For example, I'm planning to start self hosting and redo my vps setup in the following way:\n Ubuntu with docker, openssh, ufw and fail2ban, as I'm already familiar with this and it keeps it easy to what I've installed directly on Ubuntu itself. Then use Portainer with nginx reverse proxy to setup all the various services like NextCloud, wiki, etc. Probably setup 2 database instances (prod/dev) in case something breaks and so I can start fixing it without hurting production. Lastly, add something to back up the docker containers and config to an external party, just don't know which one yet. \n What I like so far: - Little directly installed on Ubuntu itself so updates are easy and I can quickly see if the problem is with docker, the service or Ubuntu - Server wise it's a bit easier to make it secure with only a few things running on Ubuntu itself - Docker itself, just nice to have everything running in containers\n What I don't like / not sure of: - Pure my config, but current setup has 1 DB for all services - I've heard that securing and updating docker containers are an absolute nightmare (I'm pretty new to docker so not sure) - Everything is running on docker, so if docker fails all fails - For all new services I'll use I have to export and import the config in the dev database (or the other way around)\n So how did you guys set up your server and what do you like and dislike about it? Maybe share your experiences so far with different setups so new (rookie) members can learn :)\n    submitted by    /u/dwarf-666  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far, everything is attached to the same bridge vmbr0, which is attached to the physical network card. Since I am getting a new drive, I wanted to reinstall my homelab and restructure its network, putting each service (or group of services) in its own network, so that they are properly isolated from each other and communication between them can be regulated by the firewall.\n The standard approach seems to be to make a series of bridges vmbrX, one for each network, and to create a virtual machine running pfSense or OPNSense managing such bridges, handling all the routing between them and vmbr0. I was wondering, however, if there is a way to do this without the additional virtual machine. Could Proxmox itself handle the routing in place of OPNSense? There are firewall settings, and there are multiple network settings (vlan, bridges, bonds), but I am not too familiar with the topic.\n Is there any good example of this setup, or do you have any advice?\n Notes:\n  \n I do not want to use NAT. Ideally, I want my local network to be something like 172.16.0.0 and each service to be on something like 172.16.X.0, where the entire subnet can be reached from my local network (barring firewall, of course).\n  \n   submitted by    /u/class_two_perversion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its a 12 bay slot but I'm only using 7 currently. I have succesfully update and installed Windows Server 2019. I am having 2 issues. I have successfully installed Raid 50 and the install drive is a 500gb Drive seperate from the Raid 50.\n The first issue is setting up the Raid 50 for the VM and sharing it as an internal Drive. I dont care if its not C:\\ but i need it to have a drive letter. I got the Raid 50 to show up once as Drive D:\\ but it went away after a couple of minutes. Now it wont allow me to connect the Windows Server 2019 to Windows 10 VM through the ISCSI Initator. Ive tried to initialize the ISCSI device that was created in Server Management ----> Files and Storage Server -------> ISCSI\n But it always says cannot connected PC on both Windows Server 2019 and the Windows 10 Hyper-V VM.\n ​\n Ive also tried a share drive and an ISCSI and a server pool both fixed and dynamic. Ive tried rebootingt he VM and the HP Proliant DL180 G6\n I've copied the IQN, IP Adress from the Host Server 2019 Computer to Windows 10 VM and vice versa in ISCSI Initiator and i always get cannot connect to PC on both. Ive also tried to find a target and it wont allow me to add it. I have no idea what to do now. The storage pool is empty and i would prefer a fixed volume for faster transfer rates. I cant find the answer anywhere. Thank you ahead of time for all comments.\n ​\n ​\n 2ND Issue:\n I Have a Nvidia Server graphics card. It doesn need a 6pin i have already installed the 16x rise.

It is also privacy friendly without any trackers.\n This web app is not (yet) as polished as Google Maps app but there are many projects that use the routing functionality of GraphHopper and offer \"complete\" apps like outdoor apps (komoot, trailrouter, ride with GPS, Locus Map, plotaroute, Kurviger) or other services (delivery hero, deutsche bahn, GLS, ...)\n And GraphHopper can be used for more things beyond routing like for reachability analysis:\n Reachability analysis across an entire country\n Make sure you follow our twitter or blog posts. For example we recently released version 3.0.\n    submitted by    /u/graphhopper  \n [link]   [comments]",

So im relatively new to all of this and making use of guides to get it working.\n One of the things I wanted to selfhost was a RSS feed which I found in FreshRSS. So I searched online for a guide on how to install this on my NAS and found this guide: https://mariushosting.com/how-to-install-freshrss-on-your-synology-nas/\n This guide explains really well how to install FreshRSS into docker but it ends there.\n So far so good followed the guide and got everything to work, installed the FeedMe app on my android phone and got my own RSS feed. Only to find out that it does not automatically refresh my feed. I have to push the actualize button myself everytime which is obviously not what I want to do. Ideally I want it to automatically refresh every X minutes.\n So the beginner I am tried searching for solutions, which I found but got none to work. On the FreshRSS website it self it states I have to do something with the ./app/actualize_script.php but the fun thing is with the guide I used mentioned above I got none of those things. Don't have the app folder nor have I the script they are talking about. The only folders I have are crontabs, keys, log, nginx, php and www. And inside those folders there is also nothing to find they are talking about.\n So for a summary I have FreshRSS running atm in a docker container on my Synology NAS which is working but only need a solution for how to automatically refresh my feed every X minutes or so.\n Does some of you have experience with this and can help a starting self hoster out?\n Thanks in advance!\n Edit: Not Refresh but FreshRSS thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Royalshadex91  \n [link]   [comments]",

This post (instagram link FYI) in particular rang alarm bells in my head this morning.\n Ive been meaning to trial hosting a PiHole instance on my Unraid server at home for the last few months and I think I just got the push I needed to take the plunge and give it a shot. From what I understand (I've done 0 reading of documentation so far) you host it, set up your preferences and then point all your devices to it as a DNS. I assume I could just set that on my Router and it would auto push that setting to all my devices inside my LAN through DHCP at the point of next timeout, or just clear the table and let it do its thing.\n My question is that assuming all the above is correct, if not a little oversimplified, I could probably also tunnel all my devices that are outside of my LAN through Wireguard and route them through my home internet connection as well, thereby benefiting from PiHole while outside of my LAN, right? Has anyone else attempted a similar thing? My home internet connection isn't blazing fast but it doesn't have a data cap. If this is something thats doable I would seriously consider upgrading my connection if it required it.\n Side note: I also realize that PiHole isn't some magic bullet that stops all this tracking garbage in its tracks but it can significantly reduce how many ads make it to my screens which is a step forwards for me.\n    submitted by    /u/sutekhxaos  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long time lurker, first time poster. \n I currently have an 8GB Raspberry Pi running OpenMediaVault and an 8TB external hard drive set up with most of my data on it (mostly just random files). I initially started this as a hobby, but I've found myself getting more into it, and using OMV on a practical level. I have some docker containers set up (nextcloud, nginx, home assistant, adguard, and a few others). I run regular backups of my phone and PC, and am looking into the possibility of backup up all of my photos there too (thanks Google).\n I want to add more storage and at least one other drive for backup/redundancy. Before I start spending money and building out, I wanted some thoughts opinions on how to go about this...\n I'm currently satisfied with the Raspberry Pi running OMV, is there any need to buy a full NAS? What are your thoughts about just buying a 4-bay external hard drive enclosure and adding drives? The 8TB I currently have is an external drive from Costco. Can I just get away with buying another one of those? If I get a multi-bay external enclosure, could upgrade to a more powerful server in the future?\n I'm stuck at the moment, as I don't know which way is the best to go. I'm looking for best bang for the buck while keep some flexibility to upgrade (storage and performance) in the future. \n Sorry for my scattered thoughts. Any help, feedback, suggestions, etc would be extremely helpful. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/tbuchsss  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got it working well using my domain name I purchased from GoDaddy for a buck, but I wanted to try and make it so it's accessible more than locally.\n I learned a tiny bit about Dynamic DNS and heard DDclient + CloudFare is a good option to go with. If I understand this right, which I probably don't, then I need to add a CNAME record on GoDaddy which routes to CloudFare. From CloudFare, I need a couple A records which point to my Pi's public IP, which is not static, so DDclient updates it continually.\n How do I set this up? How do I know what CNAME record I need to add to GoDaddy, or am I doing it wrong altogether?\n Currently, going to my domain gives me an error -\n  \n\"Error 1002: DNS points to local or disallowed IP\" \n  \nWhich according to Google, a DNS record points to CloudFares servers and I need to update my A-records. Not entirely sure what to make of this. I'm fairly certain I need to update my CName on GoDaddy but I really don't know what to update it to.\n On a sidenote, I'm not entirely sure my DDclient is working properly either and need to update the conf file, but unfortunately I do not have access to it at the moment or the logs it gives me.\n    submitted by    /u/Thifty  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I go to my domains section of mailcow admin and click DNS, this is the information in the modal:\n https://i.imgur.com/1UJLY5l.png\n So issue #1 is that I think the server is expecting/listening for the the wrong public IP. I have tried to look everywhere to change this setting, but I failed 😞. Does this mismatch matter? If so where do I change/hardcode this?\n Issue #2 is smaller, but I can't figure out how to make the TSLA certificate be \"Connection refused\" instead of the actual hash of the certificate... \n Also ports 80 and 443 for my mail.domain.tld go to a reverse proxy server and then to mailcow, whereas the mail ports go to mailcow directly from the router. My inbound and outbound port 25 is blocked by ISP. With the port checking tool, I am able to verify that all other mail ports on my public IP are listening. \n The TSLA issue I guess is an optional setting, but I think the mismatch in the IPs are not allowing the mail server to listen properly, resulting in bounces: \n https://i.imgur.com/EYx5Usc.png\n Not sure if the PTR record matters all too much either, if it does I can see about getting it modified. For the record, I'll probably be sending out through a relay, but I need to be able to receive on my own. If not, are there good options that can forward all mail to me?\n I also have a VPS which I guess I can tunnel to and set up all my DNS records to go there. If I forward all the mail ports from the VPS to mailcow, would that work? Man, I'm not looking forward to getting the iptables setup for dockerized mailcow to use a wireguard interface for wan. But I guess I saw the iptables config in some file so I could potentially just modify that.

You also want to reduce the effort in the management of this problem, automating all that is possible.\n SOLUTION 1:\n You can install and configure your own PKI+CA, release certificates etc... but this approach causes you need to import your root CA certificat…",

PhotoPrism says it needs ~ 4 GB of ram and ~ 2 cores but also says “Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should match the number of cores. ” Jellyfin has people saying it works fine with ~2 GB of ram and I expect it to use less than 2 cores And my custom apps should use way less than 2 GB of ram and less than 2 cores\n I didn’t think I needed a graphics card as 1) they are incredibly high in price rn and 2) I didn’t think any of my hosted apps would take advantage of it. Do you see a problem with this?\n Also, I’m having a problem choosing my storage. I want fast storage but with my budget (Preferably less than $700) and my internet connection (Around 100 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up), I’m not sure that I would see a difference between an HDD vs M.2 SSD.

          "description": "Hey guys,\n I'm currently writing a backup script. I have several services which are run via docker-compose. My basic idea was to stop all of them -> backing up the compose files, config + volumes and then restart. But how can I do that? \n The idea was to use labels for the containers to know which should be backed up. I can get them without a problem via bash. After that I just wanted to start them again. But how do I do that? A simple docker start \"container\" is not enough because this would not start other containers which are the base for some services. So I have to use docker-compose up -d to start them again. But for this I need to get the path to the docker-compose file. But I only have the id of the container.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/st01x  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I've gone the gambit of trying to debate how to go about this, but wanted your take on this to see if there is anything decent to do some bird watching.\n Are there any decent, easily deployable, bird watching projects to do secure streams of an outside bird feeder?\n This sounds really dumb, but the one great thing about working from home sometimes is that one of the bird feeders gets swarmed with some really cool looking birds (we're talking cardinals, blue jays, etc) and I would love it if I could deploy a decent webcam that could do motion capture for this kind of thing.\n I would deploy it on a site too if its secure as well, but wanted it to be a bit hacker proof in that I don't want anyone to be able to just control the camera. \n I kind of was thinking to have something that would be able to just record previously recorded video which I could then dump onto a video file on my site later, so it would stream initially on LAN, and then be dumped to a file on my site for public viewing later.\n Any ideas?\n ​\n I'm open to getting a Pi (Zero, 3, 4, etc) with related power banks. Its just the idea of how to power it over a whole week is what has kept me from actually doing it.\n ​\n Thanks as always!\n    submitted by    /u/BackToPlebbit69  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would basically function like a post-it shaped wiki with references between notes and aliases for notes.\n If you used another note's name in the text of your note it would automatically hyperlink to it wiki-style. You could also create a new note from text in your current note and that text would always hyperlink to that note. You could also have aliases so various versions of text would link to the same note. \n At least this is what I remember about it, but for the life of me I can't find it again now. It was on a linux machine, but I think it might have had a poor windows port at the time. \n Is there something similar, which would maybe allow the creation of stuff like mind maps, indexes, collate the notes into books, etc., but which can be hosted as a web app? I've looked at a number of apps in the awesome selfhosted list, but, at least from the descriptions, none seem to fit the bill.

I have NPM running in a Docker container via OMV and have a dozen or so subdomains working for all the different Docker containers. They all point nicely to different services running on different ports on the server and I'm very happy with how smoothly it's been going creating new Let's Encrypt certs and whatever.\n What I'm trying to do now is use the domain that I own to create a subdomain that points to a Docker container NOT on that same server. To be specific, I have a Linode server that's running something I want to be able to access at a subdomain that I own. I setup NPM on that Linode Docker in hopes that I could tie my domain.com to that as well and assign subdomains on that server but it's not working and I assume it's because I am already using that domain in the NPM container running on my home server. \n ​\n Currently:\n subdomain1.domain.com points to 192.168.1.100:1234\n subdomain2.domain.com points to 192.168.1.200:1235\n and so on, and so on.\n ​\n I would like to add:\n subdomain3.domain.com points to 75.65.55.45:1234\n    submitted by    /u/fivetwentyseven  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it worth it?\n I assume I will need to configure the server itself, and purchase a number - how is routing handled? What other things will I need to consider? It will be running on a dedicated server hosted by OVH\n Requirements would need to be free/open-sourced or low-cost and maintained.

I have some questions, i have done some research, but i figured this would be easier.\n I found navidrome a few weeks ago after dealing with constant nightmares with plex and emby. Not only does navidrome work flawlessly, but it's simple. \n The first question is what is considered the best music server to run in a container on docker? All i really need is artist, albums, genres, playlist, etc. all the basics. Navidrome doesnt have genre as of this moment but i am paired to it via play:sub on ios and it has genres. I am really going to be using navidrome on my phone when i am not home. When i am home i will be using kodi. \n The next question is about photos and videos stored on my nas. I used to use plex for music and for my photos and videos. They destroyed both music and photos and videos. Alot of the time, the videos would not play. I basically want something how plex worked. That has an app i can open and view my pics and videos fast. Right now i am using jellyfin just for my pics and videos, but it's a bit slow. I want the container to only read pics and videos, with no write access. I saw people recommending photo view which i can not install on docker synology. I also saw photoprism, but figured i would post this to what is the best route to go.\n Any other self hosted container recommendations would be great as well ! \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/kritikosxamos  \n [link]   [comments]",

So after much research I have found this service: \n https://bulkgate.com\n They have a great functionality called \"Mobile Connect\" that allows you to essentially start a server on your phone to handle the sending / receiving of messages and then relay that info back to their server / api. \n Realistically this is EXACTLY what I need (especially with their WooSMS plugin) however, sometimes the messages can take nearly 10 minutes to arrive. It's random and has no rhyme or reason as to why it takes longer, so it's difficult to debug. \n I was hoping to discover if a similar service exists or If I can self-host my own gateway like Bulkgate has done to use my cell phone to send messages. \n I have seen this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gsmmodem but have not gotten it to work and truly this would need a significant amount of development from this point. \n Anyone have any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/eternalcold  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wrote a basic guide on the steps I would go through and how this script can automate it to save time if anyone's interested.\n The Mat2 CLI alone is a great addition as it strips all the metadata from you files and it works recursively so it's fairly simple to use.\n Guide: https://articles.eoincoogan.com/protect_data.html\n Git Repo for scripts: https://github.com/CoogyEoin/Cosaint\n    submitted by    /u/esper12345  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are 3 main advantages Google Photos provide:\n 1- Safe and resilient to data loss\n 2- Simple application interface\n 3- Flexible storage\n We are working on a decentralized solution, which is indeed opensource. Solution is based on IPFS, IPLS and proxy re-encryption. Files are stored on an IPFS node, which can be synchronized with as many other nodes as user chooses to keep data safe and resilient to loss. Also data can be encrypted and saved safely on filecoin network or any normal cloud server. The node provides file management and database API through IPLD/IPFS. Developers can develop for end-users using simple-to-use APIs that are provided for each node. User can either install the open-source software on a machine manually to create a \"BOX\" node or purchase a \"BOX\" node.\n ​\n First application we made is a Google Photo replacement, which you can find here:\n functionland/photos (github.com)\n ​\n you can also read more at our website:\n https://fx.land\n I would appreciate any constructive feedback and stay tuned! \n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/a9yxrb9vik271.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d0b8e43af3c2c500c2566c297eff53398336d5c\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Jackfruit5814  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: Google thinks some people in US are not in the US, because they also have a personal VPN server at home for their family abroad. Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?\n ​\n DR:\n We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It's very similar to PiVPN.\n About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. \n For example, YouTube music says \"this service is not available in your country\" on the person's phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don't think their families were using any of these services, but can't be sure.\n We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it's always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.\n Does Anyone Else face this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/getwepn  \n [link]   [comments]",

To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. \n VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways.

Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. \n Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header.

          "description": "Hey there. I'm new to self hosting and have spent the last few days doing some research, however I still have a lot of stuff I couldn't figure out. I figured it's best I mention my use case so here goes:\n  \nPlex server: I haven't decided on plex as such but seeing as it's the most common, I might start with it. I'm okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I'm only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn't be required, but I've read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I'd like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.\n Smarthome: This is the part that I haven't done any research on so excuse me if something doesn't make sense. From my understanding I'll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I'd like to be able to do this.\n Seedbox: I'm currently seeding about 60TB of \"linux iso's\". This is spread across 20k torrents. I'd want to move all this to the new server.\n File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.\n Security system: Camera's would output and store locally in this server.\n  \nThis is all I can think of for now but I'm pretty sure I'd need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?\n I'm pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones? I'd ideally want to run all this off a single synology nas but I don't know if that's possible.\n Oh and it's also worth mentioning that I live in a studio apartment so I wouldn't want a noisy server. That pretty much eliminates most Xeons.\n    submitted by    /u/Lumpy-Hedgehog-1479  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello: right now I've got two containers that are running. A seafile container, and a gitlab container. I use nginx on the host system to proxy these, one of these containers (seafile) I installed using docker-compose, the others I have not (gitlab had a longish string for installation you needed to use). I didn't publish the ports, but left them default. When I look at posts I see people using lots of other docker containers to monitor/manage/configure their docker containers, and I'm a bit confused. I will be adding more containers for sure, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I'm using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn't going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?\n I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there's a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I'm not opposed to swapping nameservers.\n I'm sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I've spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along.

I know that's not supported in the wild.\n If I have multiple devices that utilize the same ports, can a DNS record be used to direct the traffic to the proper device?\n As an example: a service runs on port 123. Three internal LAN devices all use port 123. Can I setup my DNS such that I can route to a specific device and avoid port forwarding?\n foo A 192.168.1.10 bar B 192.168.1.51 yop C 192.168.5.20 \n Thus by requesting foo.example.com:123, it would automatically route to 192.168.1.10:123?and yop.example.com:123 would give 192.168.5.20:123?\n This seems like it should work, but I've been unable to implement it successfully on my DNS Server. Incoming traffic from the internet does not seem to utilize the internal DNS server.

Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.\n The solution I'm presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn't put all my brain cells into it)).\n What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)\n You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync\n I'm really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)\n I hope it will be useful to some people.

One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.\n I don't like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I'm being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.\n I'm curious how other people have this set up?\n Does anyone have any suggestions?\n Thanks for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/SluggishDog  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been happily running all my selfhosted stuff on a headless Ubuntu Server using VirtualBox for almost a decade now. While I've got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there's newer tech that is far more convenient. I'm super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) & allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I'm not even aware of! I'm less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.\n ​\n While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh & the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!\n ​\n I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I'm under the impression that the default used to be K8 & Docker & Ansible, but now it seems that K8 & Docker don't play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?\n ​\n Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management. I also run LDAP (not whole home) & 3 node Galera Cluster (HA MariaDB).\n    submitted by    /u/Psychological_Try559  \n [link]   [comments]",

OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:\n  \nNextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).\n Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.\n Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.\n Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. \n Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don't want to move mx'es to our new self hosted.\n  \nSo, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:\n  \nCreate users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.\n Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.\n Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.\n It's ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.\n  \nMany thanks for any suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/omgte  \n [link]   [comments]",

My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don't want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. \n I'm currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it's unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.\n    submitted by    /u/BaseTurd818  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don't mind that Tailscale isn't fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way\n It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you'd want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)\n I have no association with the project btw, I'm solely an extremely happy free-tier user\n    submitted by    /u/kitanokikori  \n [link]   [comments]",

The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output.
