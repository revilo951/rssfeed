                    <span class="article-reading-time">(1 min)</span>
                    <span>So i have decided to re-setup my self hosted services. Runs under docker with traefik(1.7) as a reverse proxy/ssl provider (lets encrypt). traefik has a middle ware thing called traefik-forward-auth that allows you to tap into an oauth provider to secure your services. One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.
 I don&#x27;t like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I&#x27;m being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.
 I&#x27;m curious how other people have this set up?
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

                    <span>This is all my setup I went through over a few days of trial and error to get myself a proper sandbox&#x27;d environment for my cameras.
 I have multiple Reolink cameras connected by a PoE switch to my Raspberry pi, which acts as a DHCP server for them and runs Shinobi as the cam software.
 All camera viewing then has to be performed through the Shinobi software, which is hosted instead off my local subnet.
 The trick is utilizing the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s wifi module + its ethernet port, allowing you to sandbox off the cameras to the Ethernet subnet (and thus requires a direct physical connection to access their data), and then view the camera footage over the wifi subnet (through your home router)
 I also have a NGINX configured reverse proxy server I use, as I have a website domain I host my stuff off of, which lets me access shinobi from anywhere (but requires login of course)
 Result: DIY Reverse Proxied Sandbox&#x27;d DVR
 Let me know if you have any questions!

                    <span>I am a software engineer who self hosts a bunch of things and has some free time. I would like to start a project and wondered if people had something missing in their self-hosting lives to get me started on ideas. So what have you always wanted to be able to self host and not been able to?

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I thought I would only remain a spectator of this community but today, I need your help ! 
 I&#x27;ve setup a NGinx Proxy Manager (Click here if you&#x27;re interested about it)
 With this reddit post : i&#x27;ve added authelia to NGinx (with the help of this post ) and it works fine with user/pass 
 but now, i&#x27;m planning to add DUO / OTP, but .. i don&#x27;t know why it just doesn&#x27;t work ! I can&#x27;t find where to activate it for my user
 here is my users_database.yml and configuration.yml
 https://pastebin.com/raw/iMXEyuPf
 ​
 i&#x27;ve tried to modify &quot;one_factor&quot; with &quot;two_factor&quot; but when it asks me DUO/OTP and I registering myself, i got this error :

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for suggestions on software, or even ideas on how to plan this out.
 We&#x27;re moving house and we need new furniture for everything since our current place has it all provided.
 I was thinking of a Kanban board of some kind. Maybe one board for each room and each big item could be a &quot;ticket&quot; (sofa/fridge etc). Then I could have To Buy/Bought/Delivered for each column and drag each item as needed. Suggestions for each item could be added as comments.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Or is there any other way people could think to organise something like this? I would love it if there were metadata that could be assigned to each item, so I could have a cost associated to a ticket then for each room I could see how much has been spent etc.
 Whatever solution has to be able to support images on tickets. Ideally I have to get my fiance to use and if the UI is not somewhat pretty/modern I know for a fact she won&#x27;t use it, no matter how good it is. I’m not sure on Kanban because I need mobile for this and from what I’ve seen a lot of them aren’t responsive on an iPhone.

                    <span>Hi there - I&#x27;m pretty new to things like this but I was wondering if anyone may be able to help me.
 Say I have a webapp and I&#x27;m using something like localhost.run to expose this app that&#x27;s running on my local port 5000.
 I run something like:
 ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 localhost.run 
 and now have a nice little link like:
 https://081e35c0012dd4.localhost.run 
 that I can share with the world. This seems nice, but also very insecure. Is it possible to secure this a bit more - namely without needing to self host my own server. In this case localhost.run is taking a lot of the work out of maintaining my own server and things are quite easy.
 One of my use cases is testing webhooks. For example, say the webhooks I&#x27;m testing publish which IP addresses you can expect the requests to be coming from. How would I go about allowlisting only these IP addresses to access my newly exposed app, if at all possible?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I am planing to create a network with multiple webservices. A reverse proxy should take care of redirecting external incoming request to the appropriate webserver. But I am unsure about the internal clients. Should they also use the reverse proxy (Variant 1) or connect directly to the webservers (Variant 2)?
 What is your best practice?
 How do you handle certificates?
 I am fan of having the same url for external and internal clients and using offical CAs (like LetsEncrypt) for internal FQDNs. Thanks anyone for your feedback.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been happily running all my selfhosted stuff on a headless Ubuntu Server using VirtualBox for almost a decade now. While I&#x27;ve got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there&#x27;s newer tech that is far more convenient. I&#x27;m super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) &amp; allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I&#x27;m not even aware of! I&#x27;m less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.
 ​
 While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh &amp; the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!
 ​
 I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I&#x27;m under the impression that the default used to be K8 &amp; Docker &amp; Ansible, but now it seems that K8 &amp; Docker don&#x27;t play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?
 ​
 Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management. I also run LDAP (not whole home) &amp; 3 node Galera Cluster (HA MariaDB).

                    <span>Hi,
 We are using OnlyOffice self hosted but only as groupware email solution - we have around 100 users, and every user has 2-5 external mailboxes connected via imap to external mail server. OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:
  
Nextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).
 Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.
 Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.
 Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. 
 Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don&#x27;t want to move mx&#x27;es to our new self hosted.
  
So, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:
  
Create users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.
 Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.
 Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.
 It&#x27;s ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.
  
Many thanks for any suggestions!

                    <span>Has anyone tried running a selfhosted instance of notebook.ai? From their readme it seems like you&#x27;re meant to run it on your machine just for development. They do have a Dockerfile, but it seems to also be just for local dev.
 Does anyone run it? How is the performance? Did you have to use AWS s3 or does it store files locally?

                    <span>My friends are finally considering moving away from Discord after recent drama, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a suitable program for a few months. I have looked at and rejected Mattermost (doesn&#x27;t have the permissions I need) and Rocket.Chat (has half the permissions but runs too slow). 
 What I really need is a chat server that can be used to restrict file uploads to specific rooms or user roles, and, at the very least, has the capability to create an &#x27;arrivals&#x27; system, where users show up to a single room before being invited to the chat at large. My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don&#x27;t want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. 
 I&#x27;m currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it&#x27;s unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.

                    <span>If you haven&#x27;t used it, Tailscale solves so many problems with connectivity / port forwarding / security. Run it on all your machines and log in, and they&#x27;re all connected and their hostnames resolve (i.e. http://mycomputer:8080). It solves One Problem, with absolutely zero config headache. I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don&#x27;t mind that Tailscale isn&#x27;t fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way
 It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you&#x27;d want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)
 I have no association with the project btw, I&#x27;m solely an extremely happy free-tier user

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

Ubuntu server &#x3D;&gt; Ubuntu server
 
 The server does have a 450 Mbits uplink connection and I&#x27;m looking for a program that actually uses the full bandwidth of the uplink, with parallel connections automatically. So, if you initiate a transfer, it should really saturate the uplink with as many parallel connections until the 450 Mbits bandwidth is used to the fullest.

                    <span>So I decided to setup an XMPP server and was surprised how simple it was. I&#x27;ve tried hosting email, cloud storage etc... before but the XMPP service I used called Prosody was super straight forward. I wrote up the basic steps if anyone was considering getting off private messaging apps.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
