                    <span>Hello ! 
 We are currently using Tallyfy which is a great tool but it’s too expensive for our usage. 
 https://tallyfy.com
 We use it when we need to onboard or offboard employees to make sure everyone in the team is doing their part of the job. 
 It’s a really nice tool, far from the scary workflow management tools I have seen elsewhere. 
 Do you have any idea about something similar which could be self hosted ? 
 Thanks !

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been looking all over the internet for something that runs from the console and does local speech recognition, and so far I haven&#x27;t found anything. Windows and Mac both have speech recognition built-in; surely there is something out there that lets me take an audio file and get the resulting text from it without going through Google cloud or something else?

 Use case: Podcasts and videos with information in them, lectures, etc. I don&#x27;t need it to be 100% accurate.

                    <span>I recently leased a VPS to host a few services, and took the first steps towards locking down the server (Ubuntu Server 20.04).
 What I have done so far:
  
Update &amp; Upgrade the system
 Install / enable unattended-upgrades &amp; apt-listchanges (automatically install important updates daily, and monitor/list changes automatically)
 Create a non-root user, add to sudoers
 Lock down SSH 
 Change to a nonstandard port
 Create &amp; configure key based SSH login (key protected with password)
 Disable root login via SSH
 Disable password login via SSH
 
 Configure Firewall 
 Create rule to allow but limit SSH in on new port
 Create rules to allow in, on other necessary ports (for me just 80 and 443)
 Set default deny for everything else.
 Rule to drop ping requests
 Enable firewall
 
 Setup fail2ban for SSH 
 Rather relaxed 15/15/15 rule (15 failed logins, in 15 minutes &#x3D; 15 minute ban)
 
 Check to make sure apparmor is enabled and in enforcement mode
  
​
 On the to-do / research list are (1) setting up mail so important system mail is sent (or forwarded from &#x27;root&#x27;) to my actual e-mail address (2) figuring out backups of some sort
 ​
 What additional steps would you take?
 What have I left out / forgotten / got wrong?

                    <span>I got a couple of services running as containers already including them sharing postgres and nginx-proxy, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how I can reuse those for Taiga. Or rather, I got postgres working, but not the nginx-proxy.
 Has anyone done this? Can I take a peek at your config? I&#x27;m totally at loss here. I&#x27;ve been googling for days :D
 I&#x27;m suspecting I have to do some custom nginx config for Taiga, but none of the stuff I have tried so far has worked. I&#x27;m not all that sure how I should get those VIRTUAL_HOST and LETSENCRYPT_HOST environment variables across to nginx-proxy either.

It needs to be very very very low bandwidth, something that just sends text and is secure. I need it to be web based so that I can access it from a work computers web browser. What direction do I need to look into for this? Thanks!

                    <span>I have a HP Proliant DL180 G6. I have two dilemmas. One being I shut my power off to do some electrical work is adding outlets to my house. I forgot to unplug/shutdown server. But all SAS drives are functional I checked the bays lights and all the drives show up in the Smart array manager. But one of the drive says rebuilding 0.19%. while rebooted from Windows server 2019, appreciation of the power again while I was rebuilding. Here&#x27;s the real dilemma. I transferred a couple terabytes worth of data over to the server. It had my entire movie and DVD collection and TV shows, over 400 movies and over 50 full tv shows s1-end. Two questions.
  
Is there a way to recover or rebuild the drive cuz every time I try just it will send my screen no black screen or just not recover.

I like the use a github system for my code, but I also need a wiki for random notes and things related to sysadmin and security; I figured they are quite similar that something might exist which faciliates both.
 Any suggestions?

 Is there any alternative to pm2 that also has a dashboard to monitor the processes and doesn&#x27;t have a free process limit?
 Can either be Self-Host, Open-Source or hosted but unlimited processes.
 Thank you

Usage will be primarily Plex/Sonarr/Radarr/Jackett/qBittorrent with one local client and possibly ~2 remote streams. I plan on getting into unRaid/Docker and exploring additional projects. I&#x27;ve never built a computer before so any feedback/resources/advice would be appreciated.
 CPU: i7-5775C or i7-4790 (whichever I can get for &lt;$150/$200)
 Motherboard: Asus z97-A
 Ram: 4x8gb whatever is compatible/cheap
 Cache: 1tb ssd
 Array: 7x6tb WD Reds
 Case: CoolerMaster n400
 Miscellaneous: power supply, fans, cpu cooler, SATA cables, SATA power cables, thermal paste
 This is the general idea, but is there anything I&#x27;m forgetting overlooking? Any concerns/bottleneck/connection issues I should be aware of? I want to spend under $2k all in.

                    <span>I can’t decide between mailcow, docker-mailserver and mailu. All look good. I currently use modoboa, it’s great but I need a solution which lives in Docker. A database-less or SQLite deployment is preferred because the VPS I use doesn’t have a lot of resources. I also hate databases. Autoconfig is preferable but there’s a separate docker image that can provide this functionality. 
 So what’s your experience with the three above?

                    <span>RSo for months I&#x27;ve been preparing for this. Scoped out hardware upgrades to my personal server, purchasing storage space to prepare for &quot;The Great TakeOut&quot;ing. See my wife and I have relied on Google Photo backups to keep copies of our marriage and family journey for the past 10+ years. Obviously they&#x27;re not High-Res 4k images or videos, but as a family photo album, using our daily driver devices, it&#x27;s been perfect. 
 As Google started showing signs of dropping this feature, I played with other incorporated &amp; pre-existing replacements which I had access. 
 Always back burner projects due to a busy life. 
 I used Amazon Photos as a Prime Member. It was fine, but UI was garbage. I bought in to Plex as a lifetime member while it was in Beta for totally legal media server uses, and was pleasa…</span>

                    <span>First, this sub is great and I find that people are helpful and not snobby. I even started listening to the podcast and enjoy it. So to everyone here: thank you. 
 I&#x27;ve got Paperless-ng up and running in Docker and even though there were some bumps, the experience really helped me to learn about how Docker works. Before Paperless-ng, I created a bash script to do the scanning and OCR for me (props to OCRmyPDF, it works great), but I didn&#x27;t have any learning or tagging system. So far it seems to work well, but I wanted to hear about other document management systems and their various strengths and weaknesses. Does one work better at invoices or does another seem to hang up on certain languages?

                    <span>I have installed nextcloud in several ways on raspberry pi4 4gb ram using nextcloud pi , custom install and docker . Docker end setup was awesome and simple but the ip it uses cant be accessed on another device under same network . It timesout any way to access it , I am noobie in this but note that my router ip and public ip are different as I believe its from router within router so I know portforwarding doesnt work . Is there anyway to portforward in secure and private way as I know there are sites like portmap.io but need best privacy respecting now ? Also is it just different issue that I cant access outside pi on same network

                    <span>Hey there,
 I am in the process of building a home server, and wanted to know if anyone knew any cool webscraping projects they&#x27;ve deployed.
 For some reason, the idea to reach out and ping different internet servers for information or to gather data, etc, sounds like a ton of fun. Its just an ocean of servers, and there&#x27;s gotta be some cool stuff to find (FTP, directories, etc).
 Any projects involving Archive.org , Wayback Machine, etc would be super cool too.
 Or if you guys have any previous webscraper or webcrawler projects you&#x27;d like to share for reference, I&#x27;m all ears. I ask because I used to be super into this to make Twitter bots that did this, and wanted to get back into this but more so for my personal website, and for my home server too.
 ​
 Thanks as always!

                    <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ve gone the gambit of trying to debate how to go about this, but wanted your take on this to see if there is anything decent to do some bird watching.
 Are there any decent, easily deployable, bird watching projects to do secure streams of an outside bird feeder?
 This sounds really dumb, but the one great thing about working from home sometimes is that one of the bird feeders gets swarmed with some really cool looking birds (we&#x27;re talking cardinals, blue jays, etc) and I would love it if I could deploy a decent webcam that could do motion capture for this kind of thing.
 I would deploy it on a site too if its secure as well, but wanted it to be a bit hacker proof in that I don&#x27;t want anyone to be able to just control the camera. 
 I kind of was thinking to have something that would be able to just record previously recorded video which I could then dump onto a video file on my site later, so it would stream initially on LAN, and then be dumped to a file on my site for public viewing later.
 Any ideas?
 ​
 I&#x27;m open to getting a Pi (Zero, 3, 4, etc) with related power banks. Its just the idea of how to power it over a whole week is what has kept me from actually doing it.
 ​
 Thanks as always!

                    <span>I want to set up a site for a community conservation group. 
 We need :
  
Forums for discussing what we want to do
 A Wiki for documenting locations, tools, and techniques
 A small public facing website so that people can find out about what we&#x27;re doing
 Single sign on
 A mobile phone app. At least for the forum.
  
Is this doable? If so what&#x27;s the easiest way to do it?

 Some time ago I read on this sub that its possible to make your server accessible using a VPN forward your requests.
 I&#x27;m still noob at this so can you tell how do I do this?

Thanks for all recommendations - I am very new to server-based use cases and applications.

                    <span>Hi,
 so currently i am looking for parts for a new homeserver build for my VMs.
 So my plan for 24/7 running VMs is:
  
2-3x Win 10 VMs with light workloads (1-2 core, 4-6gb Ram each)
 2x Linux VMs (Plex and Nextcloud) (1 core, 2-4gb Ram each)
 as well as some Linux VMs for testing Stuff (1 core, 1-2gb Ram each)
  
As Os i was planing to go with ProxMox, budget is around 800€ without any Storage or GPUs but adjustable. Further i had the idea to maybe convert the server to a cloud gaming host later on (2 gaming VMs with a GPU passed through each) bc of that the server should have plenty of PCiE Slots. Pls also consider the long therm costs (power usage), also i dont care if normal pc case or rack. 
 My first Idea was to build the server:
 CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700x (268€)
 Ram: Corsair Vengeance …</span>

                    <span>Hi selfhosted, I’m looking for something that can take a bucket of videos or photos and do some sort of image recognition on them and tag them accordingly. Specifically, porn clips and photos. I have a bucket of video clips from various tube sites that I’ve saved with almost no tagging and metadata, and with fairly generic titles that don’t include any details on the performer/actress/etc. 
 I also have a lot of properly named full videos from torrents, etc, that have performers/dates/company/etc. Those should be easy to organize in something like Stash, etc. 
 This may be harder for videos, I understand. But for photos, is there something like this, but self-hosted? Like will it recognize things like blonde, brunette, etc?
 I have a newer Synology along with a few Linux boxes (i5 4th Gen, etc) and I’m familiar enough with Docker. Does what I’m looking for exist?

                    <span>For a while I&#x27;ve had a nextcloud server running at home, but I am moving it to a self managed cloud server with an S3 Bucket mounted as external storage. I think this is much more secure in the long term , or in the event of a disaster or move.
 However I am very concerned with the security of my bucket. It isn&#x27;t public, I am using an IAM policy to control access to the data on it. However I am aware that a few years ago there were several major data breaches at companies which relied on S3 Buckets. Reading up on this they seem to have been caused by user misconfiguration, but there was at least one instance where hackers were able to access the IAM credentials thru Server Side Request Forgery. 
 My set up isn&#x27;t nearly as complex as it was for these large corporations - should I be concerned? Is an IAM policy enough or is there something else I can do to secure my data? I know that nextcloud already has a feature that lets you encrypt data , is that enough?
 Also, what storage provider do you guys prefer?

I know the command is docker run --restart&#x3D;always however I cant figure out what to put after that. Simply putting photoprism afterwards said the container could not be found. I tried docker run --restart&#x3D;always photoprism/photoprism which seemed to work, but then started something called flamboyant_neumann with the name photoprism, not the actual photoprism docker (see photo)
 What command should I use? I have the container ID number but Idk what the name would be.
 P.S. I&#x27;m using Windows because I am trained in Batch and Powershell. I know its worse, but Im more comfortable with it for my own home server.

                    <span>Hi,
 I have an Intel NUC. I&#x27;d like to use it to deploy a lot of self-hosted apps, both from open source as well as my own server application. For example, I&#x27;d like to set up a sourcegraph server so I can search over some of my repositories easily, and other kinds of servers and databases too (elasticsearch, kibana, redis, influxdb, prometheus, postgresql, maybe a docker registry or something) to get more experience and exposure.
 I&#x27;m struggling with some of the basics about starting, running, and deploying self-hosted apps. For example:
  
How do I keep my apps running all the time, even if 
 If my Intel NUC gets shut down (like, after a reboot), how do I get all the applications I was running back up again, ideally with zero fuss?
 How do I make sure all the apps I want keep running?
 How do I deploy changes to the apps? Ideally I could do this from my macbook which I use for development, and again with as little fuss as possible. In the best case, I can push a change to my GitHub repo, have a jenkins server running on my NUC run CI/CD tests, then deploy to the NUC.
 Do y&#x27;all run Docker or Kubernetes or something to run lots of apps at once?
 Also, is there a chat room or something where I can ask questions in low-latency? Like a slack or discord room you would suggest? (I haven&#x27;t used IRC yet, so I&#x27;d prefer to stick to Slack or Discord).
  
Thank you.

                    <span>I know, the point of self-hosting is to self-host. I just don&#x27;t really wanna spin up a server with 1TB of storage. Anyway, looking for some storage providers which support Borg repositories. BorgBase and Hetzner look attractive. Rsync.net is cheap and Hetzner is who hosts my VPS, so, it would make sense to spin up a Storage Box in the same place as my VPS (free internal traffic). Problem with these storage providers is that I&#x27;d need it to be on my VPN (WireGuard). I know they give a public IPv4 address so I could forward that in my DNS, but, I&#x27;d prefer it if it were on my VPN and private. I can&#x27;t decide between Rsync.net and Hetzner; what&#x27;s your experience with either one?
 ​
 Further on from that, I&#x27;m sure there are some other providers which no one knows about, those ones are usually the best. Any alternative providers you know?

                    <span>Hi, I have previously deployed wireguard using the linuxserver/wireguard docker image, and it was easy to set up with the objective of reaching my home server while away.
 Now, I&#x27;m looking to set up a vpn to connect some servers in the cloud into a subnet, without actually using the main wg server as a gateway (to avoid pinging traffic back and forth) - what I&#x27;m looking to achieve is to have different server computers accessible via a VPN network only, without proxying the traffic (ie clients use their respective gateways). Is this possible with wg? How should I set this up?
 I&#x27;m unsure as to how to set this up using docker. Nor do I have much experience with the &#x27;ip&#x27; or networking packages. How would one set this up using docker? What prerequisite knowledge is important for a successful implementation here?
 I have read the official docs but was not able to see how to achieve the gateway criteria, and also did not have full understanding of the underlying &#x27;ip&#x27; commands. Happy to get pointed to the right resources to achieve this.

                    <span>What is a very light weight forum software? As in light for the consumer/user.
 There&#x27;s a somewhat popular forum I&#x27;m on that is sorta at the point where it will fly apart(and managment has taken the &quot;I can do what I want with my 100k user forum, even if that means changing what its based on and about, go build your own&quot;stance) but a decent chunk of the users have dial up like internet speeds. As a result, we are looking for something very light.
 Why not use the same software that that forum is using? Because it hasn&#x27;t recieved any updates since 2011 and its recommended OS Windows server 2003.
 I have the internet capabilities, along with a pile of hardware sitting around and the others have knowledge in running and self hosting sites, but we can&#x27;t seem to find something light to run, or something that light.
 Please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask, but it seemed like it was worth a shot to ask here.

 Hi everybody,
 I know that lot of discussions are around about this subjects, but here I would like to collect real esperiences: your requirements, what have you tested, positive and negative aspects and what (and why) finally you have chosen and are using. So, not just short suggestions, but &quot;evidences&quot;. I think this could be more useful for people like me that are starting to face the problem. In the title I named the most famous tools in my opinions.
 As I will do, you may also post a work-in-progress situation.
 First, my one.

                    <span>I’ve been playing Minecraft for well over 10 years now, me and my buddies got into it when you were kids and it’s always stuck with us even into adulthood. Back when I was younger I would host servers on my dad‘s computer for the 5 to 10 of us that there were I wouldn’t run into any issues.
 Today, and on several other occasions in the recent college years, I have had the desire to create a server for a larger friend group around 30 players. However I would always run into an issue of “server overloaded, can’t keep up.” 
 I have a fairly decent sized home lab and in my head it should be able to handle anything I threw at it. I’ve got two R720s in an R620 each server filled with 8 GB modules to the brim in a Proxmox cluster. But even if I threw 128GB of RAM and 32 cores, it would chug when …</span>

                    <span>So I am hosting multiple apps with docker and not all of them support direct notification to those that I use like telegram and discord. Most of them only supports sending notification through smtp. Is there an app or container that can receive mail and forward them through telegram or discord? I am looking to write this myself on python since there&#x27;s a library called apprise that supports sending notification to most notification channels that I use, so I just need to work the smtp server and formatting the notification.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I had a quick question for you. I currently have a &quot;master tracker&quot; in excel where I track every single transaction/item as an expense. This excel file has with the following fields:
  
Date of Transaction
 Aggregate Vendor (e.g., Grocery Store, Health Food Store, Dollar Store)
 Specific Vendor (e.g., specific store name under the aggregate vendor - Krogers, Dollarama, etc)
 Region/Location (e.g., location of store or transaction - Dallas, Hamilton, etc)
 ID Category for transaction (e.g. GR for Groceries, VEH for vehicle related, CLT - for clothing related)
 Aggregate Item - high level category for the specific item I purchased (e.g., Fruits, Toys and Video Games)
 Specific Item being purchased (e.g., Pears, Mario 64)
 Amount of the purchase (e.g., $6.99)
 Quantity of the purchas…</span>

                    <span>A number of years ago I saw a note taking app on someone else&#x27;s PC which looked like yellow post-its, but each had a name. It would basically function like a post-it shaped wiki with references between notes and aliases for notes.
 If you used another note&#x27;s name in the text of your note it would automatically hyperlink to it wiki-style. You could also create a new note from text in your current note and that text would always hyperlink to that note. You could also have aliases so various versions of text would link to the same note. 
 At least this is what I remember about it, but for the life of me I can&#x27;t find it again now. It was on a linux machine, but I think it might have had a poor windows port at the time. 
 Is there something similar, which would maybe allow the creation of stuff like mind maps, indexes, collate the notes into books, etc., but which can be hosted as a web app? I&#x27;ve looked at a number of apps in the awesome selfhosted list, but, at least from the descriptions, none seem to fit the bill. Tidlywiki seems to come close, but I&#x27;m not so sure from what I&#x27;ve tried of it so far.
 PS. Ideally it should allow for easy upload of images, preferably in-line pasting of screenshots.

                    <span>Has anyone got any tips/ideas/suggestions on adding authentication to homer?
 Currently have my homer dashboard setup using a simple nginx web server. 
 Was wondering if there&#x27;s anything out there that I can use to add a simple authentication/login page to my homer dashboard. So when you browse to https:homer.domain.abc &gt; Login page &gt; homer dashboard. 
 I&#x27;m after something a bit more &quot;pretty&quot; then the simple http auth pop up box.

                    <span>Hi,
 I am looking for a monitoring solution running on probably one of my raspberry pies. It would be great if it can send an email in case of a host down and maybe temp is getting to high. Services and not hosts only and maybe a dashboard would be nice. At work we have Icinga but not sure if that is a bit overkill for my 5 raspberries. 
 Any idea of a cool docker Container solution for me?

 Not sure if posting in the right thread but thought i would give it a shot. Been searching the web for hours on end trying to find a company that offers both a project management like https://asana.com/ but also has a video review system built in like frame.io. I&#x27;m not sure if such a program exists but if anyone does know of any, your help would be very much appreciated! Thanks

                    <span>Seriously.
 NVR software to monitor/record cameras seems pretty basic but of all the options, none are easy or good, I&#x27;d say.
 Ignoring all the windows only crap for obvious reasons
 Zoneminder: Extremely difficult to set up, even in docker, and once you do get it set up it&#x27;s ugly as sin and hard to put on a different port.
 Shinobi: The &quot;best&quot; option but the dev is apparently a huge dick, their documentation is laughable, the UI is bad and again, very difficult to dockerize.
 Kerberos.io: Sounded great, easy to use docker, nice UI, ONE CAMERA PER DOCKER INSTANCE. Seems to be intentional to drive people toward their enterprise (paid) option.
 Unifi-video: Before it was killed, it was a ubiquiti product (avoid, awful support now, unfortunately), and very difficult to host or dockerize reasonably, especially if you want to use SSL or GOD FORBID put it behind a reverse proxy.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using FreeIPA for a long time now but it seems way overkill for my environment. Basically the only thing I use it for is keeping UIDs and GIDs consistent across all my VMs and machines, and making it so I don&#x27;t have to copy my ssh keys everywhere.
 Is there some simpler way to do this? I&#x27;ve considered making an ansible role that just has all the users and groups I need, but that seems like it might be a bit brittle.

                    <span>Hi /r/SelfHosted,
 Once again, I want to state my sincere thanks to the community for your support and feedback on Netmaker. We love hearing about new use cases and ideas on how to improve the platform. Many comments from Reddit have led to new enhancements.
 With that, I&#x27;d like to introduce Netmaker v0.5. It&#x27;s a pretty big update. Here&#x27;s a YouTube video if you want the TL;DR.
 For those unfamiliar, Netmaker is a platform for creating dynamic virtual networks using WireGuard. It takes machines running in different locations (home, office, cloud, data center), and puts them into a single flat network where they can talk to each other dynamically and securely.
 Here&#x27;s the major update: External Clients

 So it would just embed the sites. My Google-fu has failed me on this one to find anything good.

                    <span>Hi
 I&#x27;ve got an i5 NUC with 16GB RAM. Running ESXI currently, hosting a Windows Server instance that runs some custom software (twitter bots etc) and then 3x Ubuntu VMs (UniFi Controller, Home Assistant, Pi-Hole).
 Wondering if I&#x27;m making the most efficient use of my NUC? I mean, I figure I&#x27;m probably not but I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the best way forward is.
 I see I can run Docker on Windows... I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;d host all my above services?

 I&#x27;ve picked sourcehut because I really like the UI, I actually have no idea how light it is but I&#x27;m looking into having something similar as I find other alternatives having a lot of clutter, and uneeded features for me since I&#x27;m planing to have a small self hosted repository for some of my project.
 Are there any unofficial package repo for sourcehut for Ubuntu or are there any alternatives with a simple interfacte?

                    <span>Hello everyone. I just discovered this sub Reddit and this is absolutely what I wanted. Let me explain, I&#x27;m a huge Google client. I started to use Google photo to store unlimited pictures so I thought if Google have all of my pictures and data about me let it be useful and use it everywhere. Since Google photo is not unlimited anymore I want to self host my own stuff like a pi hole, a Nas, a domotic assistant, a node express test server etc. 
 So my question for you is, where to start. I see that a lot of you are hosting many things. Are you using one or many raspberry pi, are you using more powerful . I want to be able to add a &quot;module&quot;(self hosted server) one by one without breaking everything, so I can make the transition smoother.
 Note that I don&#x27;t want to get rid of Google but I don&#x27;t want to depend on it 
 Sorry if someone already explained it on a post, thanks you for helping me.

                    <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m building a solution for a client. They like the look of NextCloud but I&#x27;m concerned about stories I&#x27;ve heard about poor performance. They will primarily be using it to catalogue large amounts of photo and video files (10-20TB).
 Main features are photo &amp; video galleries, project/group based permissions, text chat, simple task management, and calendaring. NextCloud seems like a great fit for this but interested if anyone has any other suggestions which I could investigate as possible options?
 Many thanks, Adam.

I am unable to port forward for non-technical reasons (housemates, etc). I have a Digitalocean instance that I am planning to utilize as part of this. How do I set up a VPN (probably with pivpn) to access my home network without port forwarding? Does anyone have any guides I can look at? Would I need to use a reverse proxy?
 I am well-versed with the Linux command line and general programming concepts.

                    <span>This might not be possible but I can&#x27;t seem to find the right keywords to find any answers online. I have NPM running in a Docker container via OMV and have a dozen or so subdomains working for all the different Docker containers. They all point nicely to different services running on different ports on the server and I&#x27;m very happy with how smoothly it&#x27;s been going creating new Let&#x27;s Encrypt certs and whatever.
 What I&#x27;m trying to do now is use the domain that I own to create a subdomain that points to a Docker container NOT on that same server. To be specific, I have a Linode server that&#x27;s running something I want to be able to access at a subdomain that I own. I setup NPM on that Linode Docker in hopes that I could tie my domain.com to that as well and assign subdomains on that server but it&#x27;s not working and I assume it&#x27;s because I am already using that domain in the NPM container running on my home server. 
 ​
 Currently:
 subdomain1.domain.com points to 192.168.1.100:1234
 subdomain2.domain.com points to 192.168.1.200:1235
 and so on, and so on.
 ​
 I would like to add:
 subdomain3.domain.com points to 75.65.55.45:1234

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am in the early stages of setting up a business and am looking to shed some costs off our expenses and run our own VoIP server. We run everything else ourselves including web services, mail services, file storage services etc, however looking at moving to our own phone system.
 I am a server administrator by trade so have a good knowledge of this sort of stuff, however when it comes to VoIP, my knowledge is very limited.
 What is needed to set up a VoIP server? Is it worth it?
 I assume I will need to configure the server itself, and purchase a number - how is routing handled? What other things will I need to consider? It will be running on a dedicated server hosted by OVH
 Requirements would need to be free/open-sourced or low-cost and maintained. UK numbers, and have the ability to run via a smartphone and/or a desktop PC (softphone)
 If it comes down to it, I will just continue the subscription with Skype
 Any info would be amazing, thank you!
 EDIT: It would be mostly inbound for receiving support calls

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m currently develop a small application for have a dashboard/bookmark manager (a bit in the same style as Homer).
 The application is relatively simple at the moment, but I will add some features in the coming days/weeks (RSS flow, weather, browser extension for add bookmarks).
 For the moment, I don&#x27;t like the appearance very much, and I would like it to be a little more customizable (color, text size, ...).
 The application is develop in Golang and available in docker hub.
 The source code is available in Github : https://github.com/Labbs/domo
 A Kanban is available for the features I want to put and I am open to suggestions for improvements.https://github.com/Labbs/domo/projects/1

                    <span>This is an excellent subreddit and im glad i found it. I have some questions, i have done some research, but i figured this would be easier.
 I found navidrome a few weeks ago after dealing with constant nightmares with plex and emby. Not only does navidrome work flawlessly, but it&#x27;s simple. 
 The first question is what is considered the best music server to run in a container on docker? All i really need is artist, albums, genres, playlist, etc. all the basics. Navidrome doesnt have genre as of this moment but i am paired to it via play:sub on ios and it has genres. I am really going to be using navidrome on my phone when i am not home. When i am home i will be using kodi. 
 The next question is about photos and videos stored on my nas. I used to use plex for music and for my photos and videos. They destroyed both music and photos and videos. Alot of the time, the videos would not play. I basically want something how plex worked. That has an app i can open and view my pics and videos fast. Right now i am using jellyfin just for my pics and videos, but it&#x27;s a bit slow. I want the container to only read pics and videos, with no write access. I saw people recommending photo view which i can not install on docker synology. I also saw photoprism, but figured i would post this to what is the best route to go.
 Any other self hosted container recommendations would be great as well ! 
 Thank you!

                    <span>I am setting up a new Nextcloud instance in Digital Oceans and I am debating whether or not to use the Spaces storage option available on Digital Oceans or the third party storage option Wasabi. I noticed that Wasabi is 10x cheaper than Spaces, however I have seen some people say that it may not be ideal if I want to stream media remotely without downloading it. I plan on storing home movies and photos on this cloud instance, so I am not sure if Spaces would be more ideal or if there is some third affordable option that is even better?

                    <span>I&#x27;m interested in saving some or all of the sensor data from my android phone for historical purposes. Security is key so I need end-to-end encryption.
 Is there an existing android app that dumps all sensor data somewhere? It would be great if I could be able to pull up a database for keystrokes, gps location, accelerometer, possibly audio but this might require a fair amount of processing and bandwidth.
 Not intended to be some type of clandestine data collection operation. Simply my own way to store phone history.

                    <span>Hello all! 
 I recently have been tasked with integrating SMS notifications into a wordpress website to give users updates on their orders and deliveries. 
 As this is a delivery service, texting needs to be relatively immediate to avoid the drivers needing to wait outside the recipient&#x27;s home. 
 That being said, we are looking to have 2-way conversations using the phone number we&#x27;ve ALREADY established with the clients for the business. So after much research I have found this service: 
 https://bulkgate.com
 They have a great functionality called &quot;Mobile Connect&quot; that allows you to essentially start a server on your phone to handle the sending / receiving of messages and then relay that info back to their server / api. 
 Realistically this is EXACTLY what I need (especially with their WooSMS plugin) however, sometimes the messages can take nearly 10 minutes to arrive. It&#x27;s random and has no rhyme or reason as to why it takes longer, so it&#x27;s difficult to debug. 
 I was hoping to discover if a similar service exists or If I can self-host my own gateway like Bulkgate has done to use my cell phone to send messages. 
 I have seen this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.gsmmodem but have not gotten it to work and truly this would need a significant amount of development from this point. 
 Anyone have any ideas?

                    <span>So I host a lot of local services on .lan TLDs and I&#x27;d like to be able to navigate to them without having to type in http://.
 Right now when I type in &quot;nodered.lan&quot; it defaults to going to a search page. I&#x27;d like my browsers to recognize .lan as a domain and treat it as such.
 Primary browser is Edgium and secondary is Firefox.
 I haven&#x27;t had much luck figuring this out.

                    <span>While my usual go-to for a self-hosted repo would be Nexus3, I&#x27;ve been using ProGet on Linux for this recent project and it&#x27;s pretty simple..

                    <span>Hello everyone, i was wondering if any of you had any experience with VaultWarden behind caddy, and smtp through gmail?
 btw if this question is not suitable for this /r let me know and I&#x27;ll delete it.
 ​
 so if any of you had any similar configs or can point me in the right direction to find my answer I would be very grateful. 
 I configured everything from a docker run command, and then found out you can enable the admin page, and tried from there, but both methods were not successful in sending a test email.
 ​

 this is the config, I tried the tls port and forcing tls, nothing helped.
 ​
 thanks for reading to the end, have a great day!

 Hey everyone. Joe here, cofounder of Budibase.

                    <span>So for the past while I&#x27;ve been attempting to secure my files the best I can on my server. I know that files and data on enterprise cloud servers are encrypted (or at least I hope they are) and so I&#x27;ve tried to implement this just using GPG. I&#x27;m currently hosting my own Nextcloud instance but before that I was using one of the public servers that offer a certain amount of storage for free. I made a habit of removing metadata, compressing and encrypting the files so that I know that only I can access them but this became quite time consuming.
 I decided to setup some shell scripts to automate this for myself and I figured other people who are self-hosting or using a public Nextcloud server might be interested too. I wrote a basic guide on the steps I would go through and how this script can automate it to save time if anyone&#x27;s interested.
 The Mat2 CLI alone is a great addition as it strips all the metadata from you files and it works recursively so it&#x27;s fairly simple to use.

                    <span>Since Google Photos has now a disc space limit, I was thinking about a possibility to still use Google Photos and setup a self-hosted service to copy the data and delete them from Google Photos. This way I could still use their excellent app. OFC I also consider paying for the higher tier, but a self-hosted way seem to be preferable for me. 
 I&#x27;ve seen LibrePhotos mentioned here (https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/npoxm4/librephotos_a_fork_of_ownphotos_with_video_support/) and think that this + GooglePhotos backup script (e.g. https://github.com/JakeWharton/docker-gphotos-sync) could do the trick. 
 I wonder if anyone already has such a setup running or consider to do it?

                    <span>Good day.
 I have 5 servers inside a 10.0.0.0/16 private network. And I have Docker Swarm initialized with --advertise-addr 10.0.0.4.
 My main goal here is to configure Traefik v2 within that private network. So, in traefikv2.yml I have this:
 networks: public: driver: overlay attachable: true ipam: config: - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24 
 It&#x27;s ok to put my private subnet there? Which configuration do I need so Traefik works with that network inside my Swarm, and also listen to any user traffic comming from outside (let&#x27;s say a website)?
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>I need a way to backup all my Docker containers/volumes (really only the volumes, but the containers as well incase of compatibility issues) to the cloud. They&#x27;re hosted across three different devices (2x RPi and 1x VPS). Now I&#x27;m thinking about it, would probably be useful if I could backup the commands used to start all my various docker containers.
 Duplicati stuck out to me because it looks easy but I&#x27;ve read that restoring a backup is a pain. What&#x27;s your experience? If it&#x27;s not been the best, what have you used/do you use instead?
 For some insight, my docker containers have volumes attached to them (/var/lib/docker/volumes/{code-server_data, portainer_data, etc}). All I could do is backup the volumes directory and that can be done with rsync, etc. But, I&#x27;d like it to be in a nice GUI which is another reason Duplicati stuck out to me, and the fact that it integrates with Cloud, which is probably where I&#x27;d backup to.
 ​
 I could care less about the OS itself - all I&#x27;d need to do is reinstall the OS and restore the docker volume backup and off I go.

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m new to the surveillance env, but I know about the privacy issues related to most of the commercial IP cameras and their softwares.
 I&#x27;d like to build a small surveillance system for my house, just a couple of cameras that I can control remotely from an Android phone (and locally from my Linux PC to easily configure and keep an eye on my cameras when I&#x27;m home).
 I normally use Docker on my PC and have got a small remote Linux server that I use for small personal projects. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a Raspberry Pi, but I might consider to buy one. 
 What are my options, mainly privacy aware and what cameras should I buy?
 Thanks

I&#x27;m looking for a method to install Nextcloud and have it be accessible outside my home network using a VPN. What do I need to do? There are guides that mention Docker, SQL, apache, Nginx, etc. but I just end up even more lost.

                    <span>Hey folks, I wanted to spend a few months doing some personal testing to make sure everything was running stable. I&#x27;m happy to say my household has been using TaskBud for a few months now and it seems to be mostly bug free!
 Link to my project: https://github.com/SteffenBlake/TaskBud/
 What is TaskBud?
 Simply speaking its just a To-Do list app, but meant for multiple users, free to use, open source, and self hosted with support for features like:
  
CRON based repeating tasks
 &quot;Wait Until&quot; functionality
 Mobile First design
 Real Time App with SignalR, so when someone changes something you see the change asap on your screen as well.
 Markdown support
 And now with v1.1.0, basic API hooks for creating tasks! Which means you can use IFTTT or etc to bind your home assistant commands to push Tasks to the To-Do list pretty easily
 And a fair bit more!
  
I might add more API endpoints in the future if there is a demand for it, its not a lot of work but I just wanted to get what is needed for folks to be able to use their home assistants with Taskbud.
 Feel free to try it out!
 Found a bug?
 Report it here! https://github.com/SteffenBlake/TaskBud/issues

I want to be able to play my own music (locally), but also Spotify for example (if thats possible). So that I only have 1 app to find and play all of my music. thank you in advance

                    <span>Hi, everyone!
 I&#x27;m currently using a frankensteined Office PC for my server with an Intel i3-8100, 1 stick of 8GB DDR4-2666, and it&#x27;s mounted to an Xpeneology running Dell Optiplex 320.
 I&#x27;m looking into consolidating into one PC and using Unraid because y&#x27;all have definitely kickstarted my addiction to self-hosting (thanks! :) ), but this chip shortage is driving me mad when finding parts to build my PC.
 But, having the capability of running Plex transcoded streams, and many other services in unraid, while also being able to use hot-swap hard drive bays, and have a rack-mount server form factor.
 Any reccomendations? I&#x27;ve been considering getting a used prebuilt and case swapping to a 2u case, but I&#x27;m worried that it would cause incompatibility issues when upgrading hardware.
 Any advice would be helpful :)

 Short: I need somthing like buggys scriptserver. 
 Long:
 I used his scriptserver for a while now. I just want to know if anybody knew about a similar self hosting software. Maybe with more settings or which is more customizable. I need that software mostly for executing self made scripts. I hate web development ( smth. like Angular or React) I am just not creative.

                    <span>I was doing some research on this and couldn&#x27;t find an IndieWeb solution to help merge and filter content that&#x27;s coming from many sources.
 I have content that&#x27;s being added in multiple places in this form:
  
URL
 Title
 Description (optional)
 Tags (optional)
  
It&#x27;s very unlikely that I&#x27;ll ever get to 100% self-hosted, but I want all of this content to be aggregated in a self-service solution of some kind. Then I&#x27;ll be able to do more interesting filtering, reminders, automatic posting, etc.
 It becomes a little bit clearer when you look at the sources:
  
Bookmarks in pinboard.in.
 Instapaper articles.
 Notes to self as Slack messages.
 Chrome bookmarks on work machines.
 Saved Reddit posts.
 Favorites on Hacker News.
 Saved threads on Lobsters (a Reddit-like site)
 Faves on Twitter.
  
A potential solution would be to choose one of the options above, like Pinboard, and push all of the content there. That&#x27;s fine in theory, but I&#x27;d need a tool, or collection of tools to push the content to that location. Pinboard is great, but I&#x27;d still have to build some additional functionality for handling automatic posting of specific content.
 It would be much better to have all of this data in the database of a self-hosted app that I can access, or hack on the app itself. It would ideally maintain connectors for all of the sources above and add more. I have yet to find such a tool and wanted to ask here. Ultimately, I think I&#x27;ll have to just build something for myself.

                    <span>Hello Is there any script that can i self host it to see dns leaks (what is my dns servers) and also good webrtc ones and also header and timezone detection are also very welcome if available.
 And it is no problem if they be several scripts.
 Although i like to know everything possible (every one that is available) 
 I mainly prefer those who can installed on free hostings that mostly support php.
 But i like to know others also.
 Thank you very much.
 Also if you know any way to mirror well knows websites to my own domain or cloudflare (i don&#x27;t know any technical names but something like cname cloaking or better ways)
 for this leak detection websites (like ipleak, dnsleaktest, whoer and others) say that mirroring way please.
 Why i ask this is because most of these services are blocked by our idiot ISPs to prevent knowing their vulnerabilities.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hello!
 I am currently managing a small company&#x27;s infrastructure and we basically have a bunch of docker containers we have to run for each application. This runs out of a single physical machine, and all configuration is done with environment variables when possible.
 The final goal is to save these configurations on a git repository to track any changes, but, how should I organize this?
 My first idea was to create a single docker-compose file, but that quickly became huge to manage. An alternative would be to create smaller docker-compose files for each application, then create a batch script to launch each of them.
 Is there a third option that I am missing? What (and why) do you do in your case?

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m currently using Nextcloud for a bunch of things (some files but not many, contacts, notes, calendar, etc) and while it works fine for this, the calendar web interface in particular is way too slow (I&#x27;m using Nginx + PHP-FPM on amd64).
 I saw this other thread that mentioned Radicale as an alternative, but Radicale doesn&#x27;t have a web interface, which is important if I&#x27;m on a machine that I don&#x27;t have a client installed on yet.
 Does anyone know of an alternative to Nextcloud calendar that:
  
Has a fast and responsive web interface
 Supports Caldav for syncing to client devices
 Has an import function so I can import my Nextcloud calendar
  
I don&#x27;t care about any other features such as contacts or notes, because I&#x27;m happy with using Nextcloud for those for now.

                    <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been looking into creating a simple documentation site for my team members since my team has grown in size recently. I have tens of dozens of documents, instructions and step-by-step configurations for reference.
 The basic functionality that I&#x27;m looking for are for people to login and search for topics, view the documentation, check they&#x27;ve read them. Do you guys know of any such system that I can self-host in my system and share with them? I&#x27;ve been looking at sites like https://docusaurus.io and https://www.bookstackapp.com. 
 Am I in the right track? Or are there better ones for my needs?
 Thank you very much for your time reading this and for any responses.

I&#x27;m a complete beginner when it comes to this! I was thinking of just sending out links on zoom, but would appreciate if there was anything extra I could do to make video quality/ audio quality better without breaking the bank.

                    <span>If you haven&#x27;t heard about LibrePhotos, it is a self-hosted open source photo management service. It does not alter your photo library, it has support for multiple users, face recognition, geolocation, a timeline view and scene detection. 
 Five months ago a thread was posted about LibrePhotos and I got a lot of feature requests. I have been working on LibrePhotos since then. This is a quick update about features that got added since then:
  
Support for videos
 Basic support for RAW images
 It is now possible to find and delete missing photos
 You can now install LibrePhotos locally on Linux
 It is now possible to scan with multiple threads at once
 There is now a &quot;Download selected photos&quot; button
 Images for ARM64 are in testing
 You can view the REST API under /api/swagger

                    <span>We are working on a project to provide a complete Google Photos alternative. There are 3 main advantages Google Photos provide:
 1- Safe and resilient to data loss
 2- Simple application interface
 3- Flexible storage
 We are working on a decentralized solution, which is indeed opensource. Solution is based on IPFS, IPLS and proxy re-encryption. Files are stored on an IPFS node, which can be synchronized with as many other nodes as user chooses to keep data safe and resilient to loss. Also data can be encrypted and saved safely on filecoin network or any normal cloud server. The node provides file management and database API through IPLD/IPFS. Developers can develop for end-users using simple-to-use APIs that are provided for each node. User can either install the open-source software on a machine manually to create a &quot;BOX&quot; node or purchase a &quot;BOX&quot; node.
 ​
 First application we made is a Google Photo replacement, which you can find here:
 functionland/photos (github.com)

 I would appreciate any constructive feedback and stay tuned!

                    <span>Now that google is going to charge I&#x27;m going to move to a self hosted solution. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has used Plex for photos and knows how it compares with other self hosted options. I have Plex pass and use it for my movies and shows. I read that the photo libraries come with some nice features like the timeline view as well as automated tagging. Wondering if the alternatives do this as well or have other features I&#x27;m not considering.

 Ideally, a service that can serve a cached version of my website when it is down. As well as acting as a CDN for CSS, Javascript, Images.

But i just wanna get the homelab up and running again to try out new projects.
 Y&#x27;all got any good ones i should definitely try out?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m setting up Nextcloud for RSS feeds, CalDAV and some other minor applications. At home it should all work well, but what is the standard method for connecting to my Nextcloud instance when outside of my home? Set up a Wireguard tunnel? Or opening some ports and my router and exposing my network on the internet? I really don&#x27;t know what is best practice. I would like my phone to stay connected 24/7 when at work/elsewhere on my 4G connection. 
 Also, does anyone know any good books that could get me wiser on this networking stuff?

                    <span>I just installed Photoprism with Docker-compose. 
 If I write this path to an external storage, when I index all files that are now on the external HDD, will they be duplicated on the container path on the internal HDD?
 volumes: # Your photo and video files ([local path]:[container path]): - &quot;/media/externaldisk/photoprism/myphotos/originals:/photoprism/originals&quot; 
 I have 500GB of photos that I don&#x27;t want to be on my internal disk, only on external.
 How could I be sure that all files are always on the external disk?

                    <span>I need to track information of about 20 Facebook pages such as likes and engagement. It&#x27;d be cool if it comes with some nice dashboard and reporting.
 Any self-hosted solution for above requirements? 
 TIA.

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m about to launch a WordPress website that is specific to a growing community in Austin, TX. I want this website to be as fast as possible for users who will be contributing and revising articles.
 I&#x27;m torn between using Digital Ocean&#x27;s NVME droplet which the closest servers are in San Francisco, or Linode which only has SSD, but it&#x27;s closest location is in Dallas. I also feel that since this is for a specific location in TX, having a TX-based location would be appreciated by users.
 So the question is: Is storage speed faster than server location? 
 I currently have several DO $5 droplets, one of which is running my personal websites. I&#x27;m happy with the service which, but that&#x27;s just for me as I&#x27;m the lone admin.
 This new website is a separate venture. I expect several dozen users to be editing the site at the same time, and would like it to be very interactive and as instantaneous as possible. I plan on starting with the lowest tier options and upgrading as needed.
 Both companies offer a $100 credit for the first two months. I&#x27;ve considered launching both to test, but I really don&#x27;t want to spend that time testing the speed, and would rather spend time with more developing and getting the site ready for it&#x27;s initial launch.
 Any thoughts on this would be super helpful.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m looking for a good note taking app with these requisites:
 - Self hosted (obviously).
 - Have a nice iOS app that is not just a web frontend.
 - Can search both in all notes and inside a note.
 - Support categories.
 - It&#x27;s not for Nextcloud (after some years running it decided I just don&#x27;t like it).
 Nice to have:
 - Good Android app (I sometimes switch to/from Android to iPhone).
 - Open source.
 - Markdown.
 I see there are a lot of options on the awesome self-hosted list but I&#x27;m a lazy bastard and before starting to try them all I just ask here in case somebody knows some app matching these requisites.

                    <span>Hi All
 My last OS self hosted project Podgrab was received very well by this community. That project has really matured since I last posted here so I recommend that you give it a look again.
 Today I am announcing my next OS project release - Hammond
 https://github.com/akhilrex/hammond
 It is the logical successor to Clarkson, which is not being developed any more. Here is what all Hammond does
  
Multiple Vehicle management
 Multiple Users support
 Share vehicles across multiple support
 Supports different fuel types, units of measurements and currencies.
 Ability to create quick entries at the gas station/pump which can be entered properly later.
 Mobile Friendly
 Docker support
 No external database required
  
I plan to built this tool with many more features in the future so all kinds of Bug reports and Feature requests are appreciated.

                    <span>Has anyone recently installed Nginx proxy manager on a RPi using the docker compose file on their website? No matter how many different methods of install, I can never get it working. I’m using a fresh install of Debian with OMV as the base. The last install I got “bad gateway” when logging in for first time. Have never been more frustrated when installing a docker container. 
 Also, any other comparable programs? I would like to manage a reverse proxy via a GUI, as I am really a noob at Linux, docker, MySQL, etc.

                    <span>Short version: I have a wildcard cert from LetsEncrypt that handles most of my needs.
 But there is the oddball exception.
 I was curious to see if anybody here had come across a simple internal service that lets one sign CSRs using an internal CA (more realistically a chained cert that has been signed by an airgapped CA). Or even &quot;pre-generate&quot; a signed cert and key combo for future use. (Getting the trusted certificate loaded onto the devices would be an exercise left to the admin.)
 Essentially, I had been planning on hacking this together using Python and Flask, but I also don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel. Especially if the wheel is already polished, feature complete, and tested.

                    <span>TL;DR: Google thinks some people in US are not in the US, because they also have a personal VPN server at home for their family abroad. Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?
 ​
 DR:
 We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It&#x27;s very similar to PiVPN.
 About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. 
 For example, YouTube music says &quot;this service is not available in your country&quot; on the person&#x27;s phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don&#x27;t think their families were using any of these services, but can&#x27;t be sure.
 We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it&#x27;s always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.
 Does Anyone Else face this issue?

 I like the accordion style menu on the left, the code highlighting in the posts, and the highlight of the section being scrolled to on the right.
 Are there any self-hosted solutions where I can create my own docs site like this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a freemium stock image/svg/icon site, frontend app is almost done. But not sure what cloud provider I should go for - I&#x27;m fairly new to backend.
 Would Firebase/Vercel along with Fastly CDN be a good choice? My budget is $100-$150/month
 Traffic may be 100k-200k/m (I don&#x27;t know how much traffic I&#x27;d get - just telling this number for context)
 Please suggest me the best options.
 P.S. I&#x27;d love to go for AWS/Google cloud but seems like it&#x27;s only for pros :(

                    <span>Hey guys, I finally took the courage to move one more step away from the data hungry Google and alike by renting my very first VPS. 
 It&#x27;s a very basic VPS in digitalocean running Ubuntu and in which I was able to self-host my own Nextcloud server via Snap (automatic updates :] ) by following this tutorial.
 Now that I&#x27;m already paying every month for the VPS and I&#x27;ve built some momentum around researching about it, I would like to use my single VPS with ubuntu to run other services, such as Wallabag and maybe a personal Wiki, but so far I&#x27;ve been puzzled by the amount of options available to achieve what I intend.
 I heard multiple times terms such as Nginx, Traefik, Docker-Compose, ... and I wonder what would be my best bet.
 All I&#x27;m looking is for some privacy, security and ease of use so I can put all my focus on the process and not the tools :)
 I would appreciate if I could get some direction from some you that may have much more experience in self-hosting than I am.
 Thank you!!

                    <span>Hi, Im would like to host a website or app that allows to open a public case. And people can anonymously share evidence of that case (pictures, videos, audio, text, etc.) Also that anyone can view but not delete the evidence.
 Example some drunk folk hits and runs killing a child. The case gets to the media but justice isnt served because of corruption or slow process. This way maybe someone has a little piece of evidence that can help (example: some local business has a camera that allows to identify make, model and color of the car, etc.).
 And how can I host it anonymously to keep myself safe.

                    <span>Hello! Due to the fact that I use syncthing for work and home, I started to wonder if it would be possible to integrate syncthing with the calendar (android + three linux device). This is an issue that bothers me terribly, because I would not be in such a situation depends on one main server, and on a network of several computers. I was already thinking about Nextcloud / Owncloud / Radicale but unfortunately they are based on one main hardware and not syncthing on several devices. Personally, I think a decentralized network has more advantages than a centralized computer network structure. That is why I am looking for solutions involving network decentralization, because then I have control over everything working on any computer / laptop. I hope that you will help me find interesting solutions based on a decentralized network. Thanks!

                    <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m trying to figure this out for a while and I seem to be out of luck. I am running NPM with Portainer and MailCow mail server. There are lots of exposed ports to the outside (portainer 9000, mailcow UI on ports 83, etc.) and I don&#x27;t think these need to be published to the outside. Isn&#x27;t the whole idea of having the proxy manager to have only 80 and 443 ports open and the rest to be accessible only from localhost?
 Anyone has any idea how do I achieve this? 
 I&#x27;ve tried editing the mailcow nginx container and remove the published ports, but the IP won&#x27;t get assigned and it&#x27;s not working at all. Any workaround?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

                    <span>I am writing a python self hosted app (that I hope to share and others will use). I need a frontend for the user to interact with it. I am not very good with css/html or UI design in general so I am looking for something that has a lot of that already done and I just need to tell it where to put things and tie my python app in to it. Being a programmer I can figure out the JS/api to the library/coponents. Can anyone offer suggestions of web UI frontend with a library of components that can be used out of the box from a design perspective? 
 I think my layout will be kind of similar to VS code (or other IDEs) with a list of files on the left, tabs and code editor. Some status icons at the top(or bottom). I want to use Ace or code mirror for the editor.

                    <span>In the NordVPN apps there is a type of connection called Obfuscated Server which is meant to conceal the fact that you&#x27;re using a VPN from endpoints that you visit. This is the relevant bit from the link:
  
Obfuscated servers are used to bypass VPN-blocking firewalls. To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. 
 VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways. For example, data packets can be hidden using additional SSL/SSH encryption so that all the VPN metadata is out of sight. Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. 
 Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header. This way, it looks like regular HTTPS traffic filled with meaningless information. Firewalls can’t recognize it, so they let it pass.
  
Question is: How can I implement this from my home server?

 I am currently trying to tunnel docker containers via wireguard.
 VPSA:
 Location: Germany
 Hosts Matrix and other services
 Wireguard Client
 ​
 VPSB:
 Location: America
 Hosts NGINX
 Wireguard Server
 ​
 The Wireguard containers are both running and connecting with any issues. 
 I connected the Matrix container to the wireguard clients network and the matrix container has a working internet connection.
 Now for the NGINX portion I am using the jwilder container. The NGINX container is connected to the wireguard servers network. 
 The problem here is that the NGINX does not recognize the Matrix instance and I am wondering where the issue is.

                    <span>Hey there. I&#x27;m new to self hosting and have spent the last few days doing some research, however I still have a lot of stuff I couldn&#x27;t figure out. I figured it&#x27;s best I mention my use case so here goes:
  
Plex server: I haven&#x27;t decided on plex as such but seeing as it&#x27;s the most common, I might start with it. I&#x27;m okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I&#x27;m only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn&#x27;t be required, but I&#x27;ve read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I&#x27;d like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.
 Smarthome: This is the part that I haven&#x27;t done any research on so excuse me if something doesn&#x27;t make sense. From my understanding I&#x27;ll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I&#x27;d like to be able to do this.
 Seedbox: I&#x27;m currently seeding about 60TB of &quot;linux iso&#x27;s&quot;. This is spread across 20k torrents. I&#x27;d want to move all this to the new server.
 File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.
 Security system: Camera&#x27;s would output and store locally in this server.
  
This is all I can think of for now but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?
 I&#x27;m pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones? I&#x27;d ideally want to run all this off a single synology nas but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible.
 Oh and it&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I live in a studio apartment so I wouldn&#x27;t want a noisy server. That pretty much eliminates most Xeons.

                    <span>A new ISP has installed a free 100mbit ethernet line alongside 1000mbit fibre. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this. I could now easily run a public server on the 100mbit line completely separately if I wanted to without even a reverse proxy. 
 What network topology would help insulate the private from the public but, if you think it&#x27;s appropriate, keep services accessible from both networks?

                    <span>Dear reddit,
 I&#x27;m Rodolfo Berrios, creator of Chevereto which is a self-hosted image sharing solution.
 Chevereto V3.20 has been released, which is the final release in V3.X as Chevereto V4 will be released on September 2021! This release closes the cycle started in 2014 and brings massive user interface improvements, deprecates JS based effects, brings container support (real deal), improves performance, fixes tons of bugs and introduces a new testing standard. Check the Release announcement for a more granular description of the changes implemented in this one and the feedback that we got.
 💖 Chevereto is very small 2-person team from Chile and for about a while we have been building our next-gen stuff which we will start to unwrap very soon.
 Feel free to ask me your questions, also suggest me stuff you will like to see in Chevereto 😉
 Bonus: Chevereto-Free users will be happy to know that there are Future plans for Chevereto-Free

                    <span>I know I am dating myself here, but does anybody here remember the old Novell Netware screensavers? It has a red snake that runs around, and depending on CPU and IO load, the length of the snake changes. It&#x27;s great being able to just briefly glance at a montior from far away, to see how much load my system is going through. Also, if you have more than one CPU core, you can have a different colored snake for the other core. 
 My question is, does such a similar screensaver exist for Linux shells? I remember back in the late 90s, there was a Windows type screensaver for it, but it was really blurry and nowhere as authentic as the original.

                    <span>So as the title suggests, I&#x27;m looking for a lightweight nextcloud alternative, I used nextcloud but it&#x27;s not for me. It&#x27;s just too slow and I just need to access my files and don&#x27;t need any other knicks and knacks. 
 I have a smb server established but it only works on my network and not outside it, if somehow it works outside that&#x27;d be great
 Any suggestions ?

                    <span>So I just switched my NVR which now just leaves my VM with all my Docker stuff and unraid. I&#x27;m now debating on just doing bare metal Ubuntu on my r720 and then hosting everything on there. Wondering if any one has done a similar setup, not sure how i can do unraid beside Ubuntu or if it&#x27;s possible. Also open to an advice on not doing this and keeping esxi.

                    <span>Hello: right now I&#x27;ve got two containers that are running. A seafile container, and a gitlab container. I use nginx on the host system to proxy these, one of these containers (seafile) I installed using docker-compose, the others I have not (gitlab had a longish string for installation you needed to use). I didn&#x27;t publish the ports, but left them default. When I look at posts I see people using lots of other docker containers to monitor/manage/configure their docker containers, and I&#x27;m a bit confused. I will be adding more containers for sure, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I&#x27;m using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn&#x27;t going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?
 I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there&#x27;s a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I&#x27;m not opposed to swapping nameservers.
 I&#x27;m sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I&#x27;ve spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along. Any tips/ideas would be welcome. Thanks,

I was wondering if anyone had a tutorial to self host both matrix and element on the same machine not using docker?

                    <span>First of all, sorry it this isn&#x27;t the right sub for this kind of question, feel free to direct me to a better suited sub. 
 So, I&#x27;ve tried a few tutorials in the past that go about it, but I&#x27;ve never managed to get it fully working, most that I got is making a apparently working wg tunel between my RPi &amp; the VPS. Then I let it go... 
 Now, about a year later however, I&#x27;ve decided to give it another shot, and I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll find someone willing to help me, if some unexpected trouble arise, that quick googling couldn&#x27;t easily solve. 
 So, my current &quot;setup&quot;:
 I&#x27;m behind cg NAT, so no public IP, obviously.
 ​
 I wanted to start off clean, so:
 I have RPI4 available, I can install any supported os that you&#x27;d recommend, tho I&#x27;m pretty much counting on Raspbian lite (just that the last time I had to compile the wg for it from scratch, so, I hope i won&#x27;t need to do that again...). 
 I have my lite VPS running CentOS 7, also in a completely clean state, so far only purpose would be hosting the wg server. 
 I&#x27;d normally just go with the &quot;first&quot; tutorial that google would find, but given that it pretty much didn&#x27;t work out last time(s) I&#x27;ve been trying it, here I am, writing this post... 
 So, if somebody has got a &quot;tried &amp; true, verified working and not 3 years old&quot; tutorial working, for exactly this purpose, (exposing services from LAN) I&#x27;m down to just following it. 
 But since I want to get it finally fully working this time, I figured I&#x27;ll make a post, since honestly, I know a bit of Linux, and stuff, but god damn, sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m dense af... 
 So... anybody with a bit of spare time to help this noobish fool, set this up?

                    <span>I really, really want to learn more about servers, server infrastructure, virtualization, security etc. I&#x27;m a noob for now—I can mainly follow the discussions here but the only self-hosting I&#x27;ve done is a local instance of Searx (a meta-search engine) through Docker. I&#x27;m also somewhat versed in Linux and somewhat comfortable around a command-line interface. I&#x27;m a student in an area unrelated to computer science, but in the future I would really like to be a cloud engineer (and maybe even more in the future a DevOps!). 
 The reason I&#x27;m explaining my background is to show why I would want to self-host services in the first place. I believe it would be a great way of learning things in practice PLUS it would give me the means to completely de-google and have privacy-respecting tools at my dis…</span>

                    <span>Hello !
 I&#x27;m pretty new to the self-hosted world and I&#x27;m learning pretty slowly but steadily.
 I&#x27;m trying several options and one I&#x27;d like is hosting yunohost on my RPi3B and a dedicated RPi4B for NextcloudPi only (I know I can host NC with YNH but I find it slower).
 My YNH instance is accessible from outside, everything works fine. I tried installing the redirect app to use it as a reverse proxy to access my NCPi from outside, but I guess I don&#x27;t know how to configure it as it forwards to my local address (192.168.1.x) and I can only access it from home.
 I have a dedicated domain name for my NCPi instance.
 Can anyone guide me ? I don&#x27;t know where to look...

 Also want to be able to transfer files from the unraid box over the net.
 I have read that a reverse proxy is the way to go. Is there an easy solution for non techies?
 Any help appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m planning on making a self hosted Bitwarden setup on possibly a RPi Zero (which I would like to know if it&#x27;s capable of running the server on its own without any other program running), but I want to minimize all the situations in which I might get locked out of it or my house / I get robbed and the passwords get leaked, for example, using a UPS to keep the RPi on when the power goes out for up to two weeks, making encrypted backups every 14 days or hiding the system inside a wall. I&#x27;m also looking for it to be accessible by the devices I set it to be and outside of my network.

                    <span>Hello, recently I have acquired a couple of old servers. I&#x27;m plan on setting them up to be a docker swarm or kubernetes cluster since those are two things I&#x27;d like to learn. Beyond that however I have no clue on what to actually host. I already have a Cloudbox instance running on some other servers, so please don&#x27;t suggest anything that that has bundled with it.

                    <span>I have a platform where users publish their content.
 Now I want to allow the user to upload a video. But due to the high cost of video hosting, I am looking for a free solution for hosting videos.
 A solution comes to my mind:
 Publish video uploaded to my YouTube channel via API. But the problem is that if the content is illegal, YouTube will ban my channel. Isn&#x27;t true?
 ​
 My question is:
  
Is there a solution to this YouTube problem?
 Is there an even more complex free solution other than using YouTube?
  
(I am a programmer. So you can suggest programming solutions)

                    <span>Hi selfhosters, hope this is the right place to post.
 has someone successfully installed rocket.chat via docker using official docker compose file, as is?
 I&#x27;m enough noob on docker, so I have not understood all parameters... by the way, the stack starts but when I access the first time, it propose my the account admin creation process (some steps...) but even if I fill in the form it doesn&#x27;t continue. If I restart, it open directly the login page, such as the admin creation has been completed... but putting the admin user and password of course it does not work.
 Looking at the log of the container I just see some error when try to connect to mongodb container but then they seems solved (I think the rocket.chat try several time until mongodb is up); I see also error on another container that create a bot user to chat with as a test... but I do not think it is critical.
 Suggestions?

                    <span>Hi, I currently have my home smarties running on a single raspberry pi 4 and it&#x27;s lately struggling with performance, so I thought that while I am upgrading the Pi 4, I would also make myself NAS-like (seafile) and buy myself some cheap celeron mini pc (j4125 should be good upgrade) with dual gigabit Ethernet ports and 2.5gbit switch and run these two 1 gbit ports from the mini pc to a switch (also with other devices like pc&#x27;s, router, wifi) to increase it&#x27;s bandwidth for the NAS.
 Does that make sense? 
 What should I be looking for and are there any &quot;buts&quot; or downsides?

                    <span>Hi, throwaway account, non-native English speaker and a newbie to self hosting.
 I am currently experimenting with Nextcloud on a Pi4 4GB + 512 GB SSD as a docker image integration on Open Media Vault on Raspberry Pi OS.
 I have decided i want to host the following for around 5 users (decreasing order of importance):
  
Next cloud - ideally not facing the internet
 VPN to home network (facing internet)
 Pi Hole for whole network (facing internet)
 Matrix (for family only with federation turned off)
 Jitsi (facing internet)
 Email
 Wallabang
 Kodi - ideally not facing the internet and
 SearX
  
Is it ideal I use multiple Pis to achieve this or do I set it up on a single Ryzen 5/7 machine. (If the latter, docker (Should I consider something like YunoHost?) vs VMs which would be better?, I won&#x27;t need to scale anything except for storage in the future as the number of users is gonna be fixed)

                    <span>I am a student and i want to try self hosting for my projects, like my personal website and other projects
 but unfortunately i don&#x27;t have a raspberry pi or something
 i wanted to know are there any &quot;always free&quot; hosting providers that let you self host and learn selfhosting and server management?( just like the &quot;google&#x27;s always free tier&quot;)
 i am looking for always free because i don&#x27;t have money to spare at the moment and my course requires me to deal with server &amp; website related stuff for almost 4 years, but i really want to learn &amp; try out in practical rather than just seeing online videos
 ​
 Are there any decent options for me?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for something similar to Protonmail with encryption and preferably a mail app that is secure to go along with it for both Apple and Android rather than having to go to the browser on your phone to access it. I already have a dovecot/postfix server running and Protonmail is quite pricey if you have a lot of domains unless you just forward your mail through it to Protonmail but I want to be able to send as the e-mail address like you can when you link your account with Gmail and can select your from address and SMTP server to relay through. What do you guys suggest?

                    <span>First, I wasn&#x27;t to clarify -- I&#x27;m not wanting DNS to add a specific port. I know that&#x27;s not supported in the wild.
 If I have multiple devices that utilize the same ports, can a DNS record be used to direct the traffic to the proper device?
 As an example: a service runs on port 123. Three internal LAN devices all use port 123. Can I setup my DNS such that I can route to a specific device and avoid port forwarding?
 foo A 192.168.1.10 bar B 192.168.1.51 yop C 192.168.5.20 
 Thus by requesting foo.example.com:123, it would automatically route to 192.168.1.10:123?and yop.example.com:123 would give 192.168.5.20:123?
 This seems like it should work, but I&#x27;ve been unable to implement it successfully on my DNS Server. Incoming traffic from the internet does not seem to utilize the internal DNS server. Is there a way to make incoming traffic get direction from my internal DNS?
 In fact, it seems like my DNS records do nothing for redirecting incoming traffic.

I wanted something with group management and OU hierarchies that sort of follow what you would use in Active Directory. I found a lot of issues with some of the more well recommended solutions out there:
  
Samba: It&#x27;s basically an AD Domain Controller which was more than I needed; also while being feature-familiar with AD is nice, I&#x27;m not looking to implement AD, I&#x27;m looking to really stick closer to just LDAP.
 GLAuth: Interesting project, but is somewhat limited in the attributes it can handle, how group management works, how the OU structure is reflected in group membership, and usability. GLauth-ui is an interesting component …</span>

                    <span>Hey, not sure if this is the right place, but Im not sure how to google this without getting noise. I&#x27;m currently running Ubuntu as a VM on a mac mini. On that VM, i have about 20 docker containers running, including (but not limited too) Home assistant, Node Red, Pihole, Heimdal, Grocy, Organizr, Portainer, Grafana, InfluxDB, Zwave2Mqtt, ESPHome and some others.
 ​
 This afternoon, Im no longer able to access any of the web addresses, the folders shared via samba, or even SSH into the virtual machine. I can still access it on my virtual box when connecting to the mac mini. I&#x27;ve tried restarting and shutting down the VM, and even restarting services. Any idea what other options exist to try and get these functioning?
 I should mention that the docker containers are definitely running. And i can access home assistant through nabucasa. And automations and alexa integrations still work. I just can&#x27;t access any services using the VM IP or Samab or SSH
 Never had to troubleshoot linux like this before. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks for any ideas and help.

                    <span>Hello fellow self-hosters,One of my hobbies is model railroading, and I was thinking how nice it would be if I had some kind of application / database where I could track all the different models, track pieces, etc. that are in my collection. This way I could keep track things like the buy date, price, information / description and age of the various models and accessories.
 Does anyone know of self-hosted software that would achieve this?
 I figured a finances manager, like firefly iii can be used to track the items as assets, but it would be nice if there&#x27;s something more specific for this use case.

 Have multiple ios devices using photo sync to send files to local computer. 
 Android devices are using nextcloud to send to nas. 
 Wife goes through her ios photos and moves them to her folders and then those are synced to nas with syncthing.
 Nextcloud files are synced to local computer using syncthing.
 Everything is then backed up weekly to backup drives. 
 I would like an easier way of doing all this, but not sure if there is one?
 Looking to keep orginal quality and all the Metadata.

                    <span>Hi everyone !
 I&#x27;m very exited to share with you how how I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps left by the death of google play music : the lack of possibility to synchronize playlists in an efficient way
 As google play music user my main usage was to upload my music and use it to download albums, artists or playlistson my mobile. Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.
 The solution I&#x27;m presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn&#x27;t put all my brain cells into it)).
 What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)
 You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync
 I&#x27;m really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)
 I hope it will be useful to some people. Whether it&#x27;s using the solution I propose or a solution based on the same principle but better suited to your own needs.
 I am of course open to all discussions and suggestions.
 PS : I&#x27;m not a native english speaker, I do my best.

                    <span>We are currently on DO but thinking of moving to Hetzner. 
 Ping tests shows around 280ms latency (we are in South East Asia). For most of our usecase, latency is not an issue. 
 Are there any other downsides of moving to Hetzner?

 Not self hosted.
 So basically you get the benefit of selfhosted without all the technical stuff.

 ​
 Also, do you have any advice for keeping my network secure while hosting the website? I will make sure all passwords are strong and not repeated, but other than that, I&#x27;m not sure if there any other necessary steps :)

                    <span>title, I&#x27;ve been working on this on-off the last 2 years, but most progress was made the last year (lockdown amiright).
 The point is to scan your local NSFW videos &amp; images and provide a way to organize all of that stuff. Makes it easy to search for specific content (unwatched scenes, bookmarks, ratings etc) (like: &quot;show me all videos I&#x27;ve never watched featuring blondes&quot; or whatever). Media can then be accessed by any device with a web browser.
 The app supports videos (scenes), actors/actresses, movies, studios (including substudios, networks), images and scene chapters (markers). Future versions will also support image albums.
 It scales very nicely, doesn&#x27;t matter if you just have a couple of files or 10s of TB of data.

                    <span>Hi
 I am lookign for a self-hosted app that has good random photo features like creating clickable random gallery / picture wall from the root folder or from the current gallery. 
  
It can create random gallery on demand
 It can create random gallery based on the currently open gallery
 It can access to the local files (so no database import)
  
I use Piwigo for this but the random stuff is very limited, and it pulls from the root albums so %95 of the the time that is not what I need. Also it does not look like there is a way to number of photo shown, it is a fixed number.
 I do not want to use static page generators since I need this stuff to be generated on demand, static page gens are useless in this case.
 thanks

                    <span>I mainly do backend engineering involving few languages (but mostly Go).
 Right now i am trying to learn svelte as my FE framework. 
 My end goal is to become a good architect/devops and i have read it requires me to have full understanding of the whole architecture frontend/backend/cicd/server, etc. 
 So i was wondering if running selfhost apps allows me to sharpen my skill in the cicd and mnaging server part or even other than that.
 If someone has experience with this and how it affects their career and skills on this department, please do share with me

                    <span>I&#x27;m setting up a new home server and before I can get anything done I need to solve a unknown ssh issue.
 Heres the issue.
 ssh PC ---&gt; New Server : ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh PC ----&gt; Old server: works
 ssh Old Server ----&gt; New Server: works
 ssh Mobile phone ----&gt; New Server: works
 ssh New Server----&gt; Old Server: works
 ssh Old Server---&gt; PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Refused This makes sense
 ssh New Server ---&gt; PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh Mobile ----&gt;PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Restarting all the machines involved
 Restarting the ssh client on the new server
 Turning off all the firewalls (PC and New Server)
 Enabling ssh on UFW
 Tried Reinstalling the ssh client on the new server (This changed the fingerprint, but the old server could still connect to get the changed host error)
 Pinging the New Server from the PC works. Same ping as to the old one.
  
Things I&#x27;ve done to the new server:
  
Apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade
 apt install nvidia-headless-460-server
 echo &quot;blacklist floppy&quot; | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-floppy.conf Do to an I/O error I dont&#x27;t have a floppy
  
That&#x27;s it. That is all I&#x27;ve done since a clean install on bare metal. The whole thing is running on a btrfs file system if that matters. I haven&#x27;t enabled any encryption or anything else yet.
 This ssh service on the new server logs events for the clients that work but nothing at all coming from the PC. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea why it isn&#x27;t working. I didn&#x27;t test the ssh prior to the three changes above so I do not know if this was an issue previously.
 Both the old and the new server are running off the same installation image of Ubuntu server 20.04
 I would really like to get this working since I almost exclusively interact with the server using VScode on the PC.

                    <span>Hey always been wondering this, and google doesn&#x27;t yield an answer.
 For fpm docker images, what&#x27;s the difference between images that use alpine and those that don&#x27;t?
 I&#x27;m aware that alpine is one of the leanest containers out there, but is there any drawback from using alpine in production?
 If not, then why don&#x27;t all apps just skip fpm and go straight for fpm-alpine instead of giving the option for non alpine?

 I am looking for a simple web dashboard where I can add buttons and configure each of them to send a custom HTTP request.
 Is there such a thing available ?
 (Preferably big buttons kinda like the shortcut app on iOS)

                    <span>So i have decided to re-setup my self hosted services. Runs under docker with traefik(1.7) as a reverse proxy/ssl provider (lets encrypt). traefik has a middle ware thing called traefik-forward-auth that allows you to tap into an oauth provider to secure your services. One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.
 I don&#x27;t like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I&#x27;m being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.
 I&#x27;m curious how other people have this set up?
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

                    <span>This is all my setup I went through over a few days of trial and error to get myself a proper sandbox&#x27;d environment for my cameras.
 I have multiple Reolink cameras connected by a PoE switch to my Raspberry pi, which acts as a DHCP server for them and runs Shinobi as the cam software.
 All camera viewing then has to be performed through the Shinobi software, which is hosted instead off my local subnet.
 The trick is utilizing the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s wifi module + its ethernet port, allowing you to sandbox off the cameras to the Ethernet subnet (and thus requires a direct physical connection to access their data), and then view the camera footage over the wifi subnet (through your home router)
 I also have a NGINX configured reverse proxy server I use, as I have a website domain I host my stuff off of, which lets me access shinobi from anywhere (but requires login of course)
 Result: DIY Reverse Proxied Sandbox&#x27;d DVR

I would like to start a project and wondered if people had something missing in their self-hosting lives to get me started on ideas. So what have you always wanted to be able to self host and not been able to?

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I thought I would only remain a spectator of this community but today, I need your help ! 
 I&#x27;ve setup a NGinx Proxy Manager (Click here if you&#x27;re interested about it)
 With this reddit post : i&#x27;ve added authelia to NGinx (with the help of this post ) and it works fine with user/pass 
 but now, i&#x27;m planning to add DUO / OTP, but .. i don&#x27;t know why it just doesn&#x27;t work ! I can&#x27;t find where to activate it for my user
 here is my users_database.yml and configuration.yml
 https://pastebin.com/raw/iMXEyuPf
 ​
 i&#x27;ve tried to modify &quot;one_factor&quot; with &quot;two_factor&quot; but when it asks me DUO/OTP and I registering myself, i got this error :

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for suggestions on software, or even ideas on how to plan this out.
 We&#x27;re moving house and we need new furniture for everything since our current place has it all provided.
 I was thinking of a Kanban board of some kind. Maybe one board for each room and each big item could be a &quot;ticket&quot; (sofa/fridge etc). Then I could have To Buy/Bought/Delivered for each column and drag each item as needed. Suggestions for each item could be added as comments.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Or is there any other way people could think to organise something like this? I would love it if there were metadata that could be assigned to each item, so I could have a cost associated to a ticket then for each room I could see how much has been spent etc.
 Whatever solution has to be able to support images on tickets. Ideally I have to get my fiance to use and if the UI is not somewhat pretty/modern I know for a fact she won&#x27;t use it, no matter how good it is. I’m not sure on Kanban because I need mobile for this and from what I’ve seen a lot of them aren’t responsive on an iPhone.

                    <span>Hi there - I&#x27;m pretty new to things like this but I was wondering if anyone may be able to help me.
 Say I have a webapp and I&#x27;m using something like localhost.run to expose this app that&#x27;s running on my local port 5000.
 I run something like:
 ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 localhost.run 
 and now have a nice little link like:
 https://081e35c0012dd4.localhost.run 
 that I can share with the world. This seems nice, but also very insecure. Is it possible to secure this a bit more - namely without needing to self host my own server. In this case localhost.run is taking a lot of the work out of maintaining my own server and things are quite easy.
 One of my use cases is testing webhooks. For example, say the webhooks I&#x27;m testing publish which IP addresses you can expect the requests to be coming from. How would I go about allowlisting only these IP addresses to access my newly exposed app, if at all possible?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I am planing to create a network with multiple webservices. A reverse proxy should take care of redirecting external incoming request to the appropriate webserver. But I am unsure about the internal clients. Should they also use the reverse proxy (Variant 1) or connect directly to the webservers (Variant 2)?
 What is your best practice?
 How do you handle certificates?
 I am fan of having the same url for external and internal clients and using offical CAs (like LetsEncrypt) for internal FQDNs. Thanks anyone for your feedback.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been happily running all my selfhosted stuff on a headless Ubuntu Server using VirtualBox for almost a decade now. While I&#x27;ve got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there&#x27;s newer tech that is far more convenient. I&#x27;m super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) &amp; allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I&#x27;m not even aware of! I&#x27;m less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.
 ​
 While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh &amp; the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!
 ​
 I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I&#x27;m under the impression that the default used to be K8 &amp; Docker &amp; Ansible, but now it seems that K8 &amp; Docker don&#x27;t play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?
 ​
 Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management. I also run LDAP (not whole home) &amp; 3 node Galera Cluster (HA MariaDB).

                    <span>Hi,
 We are using OnlyOffice self hosted but only as groupware email solution - we have around 100 users, and every user has 2-5 external mailboxes connected via imap to external mail server. OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:
  
Nextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).
 Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.
 Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.
 Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. 
 Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don&#x27;t want to move mx&#x27;es to our new self hosted.
  
So, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:
  
Create users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.
 Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.
 Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.
 It&#x27;s ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.
  
Many thanks for any suggestions!

                    <span>Has anyone tried running a selfhosted instance of notebook.ai? From their readme it seems like you&#x27;re meant to run it on your machine just for development. They do have a Dockerfile, but it seems to also be just for local dev.
 Does anyone run it? How is the performance? Did you have to use AWS s3 or does it store files locally?

                    <span>My friends are finally considering moving away from Discord after recent drama, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a suitable program for a few months. I have looked at and rejected Mattermost (doesn&#x27;t have the permissions I need) and Rocket.Chat (has half the permissions but runs too slow). 
 What I really need is a chat server that can be used to restrict file uploads to specific rooms or user roles, and, at the very least, has the capability to create an &#x27;arrivals&#x27; system, where users show up to a single room before being invited to the chat at large. My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don&#x27;t want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. 
 I&#x27;m currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it&#x27;s unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.

                    <span>If you haven&#x27;t used it, Tailscale solves so many problems with connectivity / port forwarding / security. Run it on all your machines and log in, and they&#x27;re all connected and their hostnames resolve (i.e. http://mycomputer:8080). It solves One Problem, with absolutely zero config headache. I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don&#x27;t mind that Tailscale isn&#x27;t fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way
 It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you&#x27;d want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)
 I have no association with the project btw, I&#x27;m solely an extremely happy free-tier user

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>I want to transfer several tar files (each ~ 2 GB) from:
  
Ubuntu server &#x3D;&gt; Windows 10 PC
 
Ubuntu server &#x3D;&gt; Ubuntu server
 
 The server does have a 450 Mbits uplink connection and I&#x27;m looking for a program that actually uses the full bandwidth of the uplink, with parallel connections automatically. So, if you initiate a transfer, it should really saturate the uplink with as many parallel connections until the 450 Mbits bandwidth is used to the fullest.

                    <span>So I decided to setup an XMPP server and was surprised how simple it was. I&#x27;ve tried hosting email, cloud storage etc... before but the XMPP service I used called Prosody was super straight forward. I wrote up the basic steps if anyone was considering getting off private messaging apps.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
