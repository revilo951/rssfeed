                    <span>Now that google is going to charge I&#x27;m going to move to a self hosted solution. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has used Plex for photos and knows how it compares with other self hosted options. I have Plex pass and use it for my movies and shows. I read that the photo libraries come with some nice features like the timeline view as well as automated tagging. Wondering if the alternatives do this as well or have other features I&#x27;m not considering.

 Ideally, a service that can serve a cached version of my website when it is down. As well as acting as a CDN for CSS, Javascript, Images.

                    <span>Major bummer vibes, tested positive after a routine check before travelling abroad. So it is quarantaine o&#x27;clock instead of holiday vibes. Fuck everything, but at least i have some time to get back into homelabbing. It&#x27;s been a little stuck while i&#x27;m trying to setup a proper network with VLANs and an actual firewall. But i just wanna get the homelab up and running again to try out new projects.
 Y&#x27;all got any good ones i should definitely try out?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m setting up Nextcloud for RSS feeds, CalDAV and some other minor applications. At home it should all work well, but what is the standard method for connecting to my Nextcloud instance when outside of my home? Set up a Wireguard tunnel? Or opening some ports and my router and exposing my network on the internet? I really don&#x27;t know what is best practice. I would like my phone to stay connected 24/7 when at work/elsewhere on my 4G connection. 
 Also, does anyone know any good books that could get me wiser on this networking stuff?

                    <span>I just installed Photoprism with Docker-compose. 
 If I write this path to an external storage, when I index all files that are now on the external HDD, will they be duplicated on the container path on the internal HDD?
 volumes: # Your photo and video files ([local path]:[container path]): - &quot;/media/externaldisk/photoprism/myphotos/originals:/photoprism/originals&quot; 
 I have 500GB of photos that I don&#x27;t want to be on my internal disk, only on external.
 How could I be sure that all files are always on the external disk?

                    <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m about to launch a WordPress website that is specific to a growing community in Austin, TX. I want this website to be as fast as possible for users who will be contributing and revising articles.
 I&#x27;m torn between using Digital Ocean&#x27;s NVME droplet which the closest servers are in San Francisco, or Linode which only has SSD, but it&#x27;s closest location is in Dallas. I also feel that since this is for a specific location in TX, having a TX-based location would be appreciated by users.
 So the question is: Is storage speed faster than server location? 
 I currently have several DO $5 droplets, one of which is running my personal websites. I&#x27;m happy with the service which, but that&#x27;s just for me as I&#x27;m the lone admin.
 This new website is a separate venture. I expect several dozen users to be editing the site at the same time, and would like it to be very interactive and as instantaneous as possible. I plan on starting with the lowest tier options and upgrading as needed.
 Both companies offer a $100 credit for the first two months. I&#x27;ve considered launching both to test, but I really don&#x27;t want to spend that time testing the speed, and would rather spend time with more developing and getting the site ready for it&#x27;s initial launch.
 Any thoughts on this would be super helpful.

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;m looking for a good note taking app with these requisites:
 - Self hosted (obviously).
 - Have a nice iOS app that is not just a web frontend.
 - Can search both in all notes and inside a note.
 - Support categories.
 - It&#x27;s not for Nextcloud (after some years running it decided I just don&#x27;t like it).
 Nice to have:
 - Good Android app (I sometimes switch to/from Android to iPhone).
 - Open source.
 - Markdown.
 I see there are a lot of options on the awesome self-hosted list but I&#x27;m a lazy bastard and before starting to try them all I just ask here in case somebody knows some app matching these requisites.

                    <span>Hi All
 My last OS self hosted project Podgrab was received very well by this community. That project has really matured since I last posted here so I recommend that you give it a look again.
 Today I am announcing my next OS project release - Hammond
 https://github.com/akhilrex/hammond
 It is the logical successor to Clarkson, which is not being developed any more. Here is what all Hammond does
  
Multiple Vehicle management
 Multiple Users support
 Share vehicles across multiple support
 Supports different fuel types, units of measurements and currencies.
 Ability to create quick entries at the gas station/pump which can be entered properly later.
 Mobile Friendly
 Docker support
 No external database required
  
I plan to built this tool with many more features in the future so all kinds of Bug reports and Feature requests are appreciated.

                    <span>Has anyone recently installed Nginx proxy manager on a RPi using the docker compose file on their website? No matter how many different methods of install, I can never get it working. I’m using a fresh install of Debian with OMV as the base. The last install I got “bad gateway” when logging in for first time. Have never been more frustrated when installing a docker container. 
 Also, any other comparable programs? I would like to manage a reverse proxy via a GUI, as I am really a noob at Linux, docker, MySQL, etc.

                    <span>Short version: I have a wildcard cert from LetsEncrypt that handles most of my needs.
 But there is the oddball exception.
 I was curious to see if anybody here had come across a simple internal service that lets one sign CSRs using an internal CA (more realistically a chained cert that has been signed by an airgapped CA). Or even &quot;pre-generate&quot; a signed cert and key combo for future use. (Getting the trusted certificate loaded onto the devices would be an exercise left to the admin.)
 Essentially, I had been planning on hacking this together using Python and Flask, but I also don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel. Especially if the wheel is already polished, feature complete, and tested.

                    <span>TL;DR: Google thinks some people in US are not in the US, because they also have a personal VPN server at home for their family abroad. Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?
 ​
 DR:
 We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It&#x27;s very similar to PiVPN.
 About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. 
 For example, YouTube music says &quot;this service is not available in your country&quot; on the person&#x27;s phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don&#x27;t think their families were using any of these services, but can&#x27;t be sure.
 We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it&#x27;s always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.
 Does Anyone Else face this issue?

 I like the accordion style menu on the left, the code highlighting in the posts, and the highlight of the section being scrolled to on the right.
 Are there any self-hosted solutions where I can create my own docs site like this?

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on a freemium stock image/svg/icon site, frontend app is almost done. But not sure what cloud provider I should go for - I&#x27;m fairly new to backend.
 Would Firebase/Vercel along with Fastly CDN be a good choice? My budget is $100-$150/month
 Traffic may be 100k-200k/m (I don&#x27;t know how much traffic I&#x27;d get - just telling this number for context)
 Please suggest me the best options.
 P.S. I&#x27;d love to go for AWS/Google cloud but seems like it&#x27;s only for pros :(

                    <span>Hey guys, I finally took the courage to move one more step away from the data hungry Google and alike by renting my very first VPS. 
 It&#x27;s a very basic VPS in digitalocean running Ubuntu and in which I was able to self-host my own Nextcloud server via Snap (automatic updates :] ) by following this tutorial.
 Now that I&#x27;m already paying every month for the VPS and I&#x27;ve built some momentum around researching about it, I would like to use my single VPS with ubuntu to run other services, such as Wallabag and maybe a personal Wiki, but so far I&#x27;ve been puzzled by the amount of options available to achieve what I intend.
 I heard multiple times terms such as Nginx, Traefik, Docker-Compose, ... and I wonder what would be my best bet.
 All I&#x27;m looking is for some privacy, security and ease of use so I can put all my focus on the process and not the tools :)
 I would appreciate if I could get some direction from some you that may have much more experience in self-hosting than I am.
 Thank you!!

                    <span>Hi, Im would like to host a website or app that allows to open a public case. And people can anonymously share evidence of that case (pictures, videos, audio, text, etc.) Also that anyone can view but not delete the evidence.
 Example some drunk folk hits and runs killing a child. The case gets to the media but justice isnt served because of corruption or slow process. This way maybe someone has a little piece of evidence that can help (example: some local business has a camera that allows to identify make, model and color of the car, etc.).
 And how can I host it anonymously to keep myself safe.

                    <span>Hello! Due to the fact that I use syncthing for work and home, I started to wonder if it would be possible to integrate syncthing with the calendar (android + three linux device). This is an issue that bothers me terribly, because I would not be in such a situation depends on one main server, and on a network of several computers. I was already thinking about Nextcloud / Owncloud / Radicale but unfortunately they are based on one main hardware and not syncthing on several devices. Personally, I think a decentralized network has more advantages than a centralized computer network structure. That is why I am looking for solutions involving network decentralization, because then I have control over everything working on any computer / laptop. I hope that you will help me find interesting solutions based on a decentralized network. Thanks!

                    <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m trying to figure this out for a while and I seem to be out of luck. I am running NPM with Portainer and MailCow mail server. There are lots of exposed ports to the outside (portainer 9000, mailcow UI on ports 83, etc.) and I don&#x27;t think these need to be published to the outside. Isn&#x27;t the whole idea of having the proxy manager to have only 80 and 443 ports open and the rest to be accessible only from localhost?
 Anyone has any idea how do I achieve this? 
 I&#x27;ve tried editing the mailcow nginx container and remove the published ports, but the IP won&#x27;t get assigned and it&#x27;s not working at all. Any workaround?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

                    <span>I am writing a python self hosted app (that I hope to share and others will use). I need a frontend for the user to interact with it. I am not very good with css/html or UI design in general so I am looking for something that has a lot of that already done and I just need to tell it where to put things and tie my python app in to it. Being a programmer I can figure out the JS/api to the library/coponents. Can anyone offer suggestions of web UI frontend with a library of components that can be used out of the box from a design perspective? 
 I think my layout will be kind of similar to VS code (or other IDEs) with a list of files on the left, tabs and code editor. Some status icons at the top(or bottom). I want to use Ace or code mirror for the editor.

                    <span>In the NordVPN apps there is a type of connection called Obfuscated Server which is meant to conceal the fact that you&#x27;re using a VPN from endpoints that you visit. This is the relevant bit from the link:
  
Obfuscated servers are used to bypass VPN-blocking firewalls. To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. 
 VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways. For example, data packets can be hidden using additional SSL/SSH encryption so that all the VPN metadata is out of sight. Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. 
 Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header. This way, it looks like regular HTTPS traffic filled with meaningless information. Firewalls can’t recognize it, so they let it pass.
  
Question is: How can I implement this from my home server?

Does anyone know of any software that does this? I know commerical solutions currently do a good job at this, but I am looking to get a hold of some software I can dabble with and change. Thank you!

                    <span>Hello,
 I am currently trying to tunnel docker containers via wireguard.
 VPSA:
 Location: Germany
 Hosts Matrix and other services
 Wireguard Client
 ​
 VPSB:
 Location: America
 Hosts NGINX
 Wireguard Server
 ​
 The Wireguard containers are both running and connecting with any issues. 
 I connected the Matrix container to the wireguard clients network and the matrix container has a working internet connection.
 Now for the NGINX portion I am using the jwilder container. The NGINX container is connected to the wireguard servers network. 
 The problem here is that the NGINX does not recognize the Matrix instance and I am wondering where the issue is.

                    <span>Hey there. I&#x27;m new to self hosting and have spent the last few days doing some research, however I still have a lot of stuff I couldn&#x27;t figure out. I figured it&#x27;s best I mention my use case so here goes:
  
Plex server: I haven&#x27;t decided on plex as such but seeing as it&#x27;s the most common, I might start with it. I&#x27;m okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I&#x27;m only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn&#x27;t be required, but I&#x27;ve read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I&#x27;d like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.
 Smarthome: This is the part that I haven&#x27;t done any research on so excuse me if something doesn&#x27;t make sense. From my understanding I&#x27;ll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I&#x27;d like to be able to do this.
 Seedbox: I&#x27;m currently seeding about 60TB of &quot;linux iso&#x27;s&quot;. This is spread across 20k torrents. I&#x27;d want to move all this to the new server.
 File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.
 Security system: Camera&#x27;s would output and store locally in this server.
  
This is all I can think of for now but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?
 I&#x27;m pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones? I&#x27;d ideally want to run all this off a single synology nas but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible.
 Oh and it&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I live in a studio apartment so I wouldn&#x27;t want a noisy server. That pretty much eliminates most Xeons.

                    <span>A new ISP has installed a free 100mbit ethernet line alongside 1000mbit fibre. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this. I could now easily run a public server on the 100mbit line completely separately if I wanted to without even a reverse proxy. 
 What network topology would help insulate the private from the public but, if you think it&#x27;s appropriate, keep services accessible from both networks?

                    <span>I know I am dating myself here, but does anybody here remember the old Novell Netware screensavers? It has a red snake that runs around, and depending on CPU and IO load, the length of the snake changes. It&#x27;s great being able to just briefly glance at a montior from far away, to see how much load my system is going through. Also, if you have more than one CPU core, you can have a different colored snake for the other core. 
 My question is, does such a similar screensaver exist for Linux shells? I remember back in the late 90s, there was a Windows type screensaver for it, but it was really blurry and nowhere as authentic as the original.

                    <span>So as the title suggests, I&#x27;m looking for a lightweight nextcloud alternative, I used nextcloud but it&#x27;s not for me. It&#x27;s just too slow and I just need to access my files and don&#x27;t need any other knicks and knacks. 
 I have a smb server established but it only works on my network and not outside it, if somehow it works outside that&#x27;d be great
 Any suggestions ?

                    <span>So I just switched my NVR which now just leaves my VM with all my Docker stuff and unraid. I&#x27;m now debating on just doing bare metal Ubuntu on my r720 and then hosting everything on there. Wondering if any one has done a similar setup, not sure how i can do unraid beside Ubuntu or if it&#x27;s possible. Also open to an advice on not doing this and keeping esxi.

                    <span>Hello: right now I&#x27;ve got two containers that are running. A seafile container, and a gitlab container. I use nginx on the host system to proxy these, one of these containers (seafile) I installed using docker-compose, the others I have not (gitlab had a longish string for installation you needed to use). I didn&#x27;t publish the ports, but left them default. When I look at posts I see people using lots of other docker containers to monitor/manage/configure their docker containers, and I&#x27;m a bit confused. I will be adding more containers for sure, so I&#x27;m trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I&#x27;m using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn&#x27;t going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?
 I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there&#x27;s a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I&#x27;m not opposed to swapping nameservers.
 I&#x27;m sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I&#x27;ve spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along. Any tips/ideas would be welcome. Thanks,

                    <span>I know someone already posted about this here but it seemed like the only response that was given was either &quot;please sign up for my hosting service&quot; or just how to install matrix. I was wondering if anyone had a tutorial to self host both matrix and element on the same machine not using docker?

                    <span>First of all, sorry it this isn&#x27;t the right sub for this kind of question, feel free to direct me to a better suited sub. 
 So, I&#x27;ve tried a few tutorials in the past that go about it, but I&#x27;ve never managed to get it fully working, most that I got is making a apparently working wg tunel between my RPi &amp; the VPS. Then I let it go... 
 Now, about a year later however, I&#x27;ve decided to give it another shot, and I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll find someone willing to help me, if some unexpected trouble arise, that quick googling couldn&#x27;t easily solve. 
 So, my current &quot;setup&quot;:
 I&#x27;m behind cg NAT, so no public IP, obviously.
 ​
 I wanted to start off clean, so:
 I have RPI4 available, I can install any supported os that you&#x27;d recommend, tho I&#x27;m pretty much counting on Raspbian lite (just that the last time I had to compile the wg for it from scratch, so, I hope i won&#x27;t need to do that again...). 
 I have my lite VPS running CentOS 7, also in a completely clean state, so far only purpose would be hosting the wg server. 
 I&#x27;d normally just go with the &quot;first&quot; tutorial that google would find, but given that it pretty much didn&#x27;t work out last time(s) I&#x27;ve been trying it, here I am, writing this post... 
 So, if somebody has got a &quot;tried &amp; true, verified working and not 3 years old&quot; tutorial working, for exactly this purpose, (exposing services from LAN) I&#x27;m down to just following it. 
 But since I want to get it finally fully working this time, I figured I&#x27;ll make a post, since honestly, I know a bit of Linux, and stuff, but god damn, sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m dense af... 
 So... anybody with a bit of spare time to help this noobish fool, set this up?

                    <span>I really, really want to learn more about servers, server infrastructure, virtualization, security etc. I&#x27;m a noob for now—I can mainly follow the discussions here but the only self-hosting I&#x27;ve done is a local instance of Searx (a meta-search engine) through Docker. I&#x27;m also somewhat versed in Linux and somewhat comfortable around a command-line interface. I&#x27;m a student in an area unrelated to computer science, but in the future I would really like to be a cloud engineer (and maybe even more in the future a DevOps!). 
 The reason I&#x27;m explaining my background is to show why I would want to self-host services in the first place. I believe it would be a great way of learning things in practice PLUS it would give me the means to completely de-google and have privacy-respecting tools at my dis…</span>

                    <span>Hello !
 I&#x27;m pretty new to the self-hosted world and I&#x27;m learning pretty slowly but steadily.
 I&#x27;m trying several options and one I&#x27;d like is hosting yunohost on my RPi3B and a dedicated RPi4B for NextcloudPi only (I know I can host NC with YNH but I find it slower).
 My YNH instance is accessible from outside, everything works fine. I tried installing the redirect app to use it as a reverse proxy to access my NCPi from outside, but I guess I don&#x27;t know how to configure it as it forwards to my local address (192.168.1.x) and I can only access it from home.
 I have a dedicated domain name for my NCPi instance.
 Can anyone guide me ? I don&#x27;t know where to look...

 I have read that a reverse proxy is the way to go. Is there an easy solution for non techies?

I&#x27;m also looking for it to be accessible by the devices I set it to be and outside of my network.

I&#x27;m plan on setting them up to be a docker swarm or kubernetes cluster since those are two things I&#x27;d like to learn. Beyond that however I have no clue on what to actually host. I already have a Cloudbox instance running on some other servers, so please don&#x27;t suggest anything that that has bundled with it.

                    <span>I have a platform where users publish their content.
 Now I want to allow the user to upload a video. But due to the high cost of video hosting, I am looking for a free solution for hosting videos.
 A solution comes to my mind:
 Publish video uploaded to my YouTube channel via API. But the problem is that if the content is illegal, YouTube will ban my channel. Isn&#x27;t true?
 ​
 My question is:
  
Is there a solution to this YouTube problem?
 Is there an even more complex free solution other than using YouTube?
  
(I am a programmer. So you can suggest programming solutions)

 has someone successfully installed rocket.chat via docker using official docker compose file, as is?
 I&#x27;m enough noob on docker, so I have not understood all parameters... by the way, the stack starts but when I access the first time, it propose my the account admin creation process (some steps...) but even if I fill in the form it doesn&#x27;t continue. If I restart, it open directly the login page, such as the admin creation has been completed... but putting the admin user and password of course it does not work.
 Looking at the log of the container I just see some error when try to connect to mongodb container but then they seems solved (I think the rocket.chat try several time until mongodb is up); I see also error on another container that create a bot user to chat with as a test... but I do not think it is critical.
 Suggestions?

                    <span>Hi, I currently have my home smarties running on a single raspberry pi 4 and it&#x27;s lately struggling with performance, so I thought that while I am upgrading the Pi 4, I would also make myself NAS-like (seafile) and buy myself some cheap celeron mini pc (j4125 should be good upgrade) with dual gigabit Ethernet ports and 2.5gbit switch and run these two 1 gbit ports from the mini pc to a switch (also with other devices like pc&#x27;s, router, wifi) to increase it&#x27;s bandwidth for the NAS.
 Does that make sense? 
 What should I be looking for and are there any &quot;buts&quot; or downsides?

                    <span>Hi, throwaway account, non-native English speaker and a newbie to self hosting.
 I am currently experimenting with Nextcloud on a Pi4 4GB + 512 GB SSD as a docker image integration on Open Media Vault on Raspberry Pi OS.
 I have decided i want to host the following for around 5 users (decreasing order of importance):
  
Next cloud - ideally not facing the internet
 VPN to home network (facing internet)
 Pi Hole for whole network (facing internet)
 Matrix (for family only with federation turned off)
 Jitsi (facing internet)
 Email
 Wallabang
 Kodi - ideally not facing the internet and
 SearX
  
Is it ideal I use multiple Pis to achieve this or do I set it up on a single Ryzen 5/7 machine. (If the latter, docker (Should I consider something like YunoHost?) vs VMs which would be better?, I won&#x27;t need to scale anything except for storage in the future as the number of users is gonna be fixed)

                    <span>I am a student and i want to try self hosting for my projects, like my personal website and other projects
 but unfortunately i don&#x27;t have a raspberry pi or something
 i wanted to know are there any &quot;always free&quot; hosting providers that let you self host and learn selfhosting and server management?( just like the &quot;google&#x27;s always free tier&quot;)
 i am looking for always free because i don&#x27;t have money to spare at the moment and my course requires me to deal with server &amp; website related stuff for almost 4 years, but i really want to learn &amp; try out in practical rather than just seeing online videos
 ​
 Are there any decent options for me?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for something similar to Protonmail with encryption and preferably a mail app that is secure to go along with it for both Apple and Android rather than having to go to the browser on your phone to access it. I already have a dovecot/postfix server running and Protonmail is quite pricey if you have a lot of domains unless you just forward your mail through it to Protonmail but I want to be able to send as the e-mail address like you can when you link your account with Gmail and can select your from address and SMTP server to relay through. What do you guys suggest?

                    <span>First, I wasn&#x27;t to clarify -- I&#x27;m not wanting DNS to add a specific port. I know that&#x27;s not supported in the wild.
 If I have multiple devices that utilize the same ports, can a DNS record be used to direct the traffic to the proper device?
 As an example: a service runs on port 123. Three internal LAN devices all use port 123. Can I setup my DNS such that I can route to a specific device and avoid port forwarding?
 foo A 192.168.1.10 bar B 192.168.1.51 yop C 192.168.5.20 
 Thus by requesting foo.example.com:123, it would automatically route to 192.168.1.10:123?and yop.example.com:123 would give 192.168.5.20:123?
 This seems like it should work, but I&#x27;ve been unable to implement it successfully on my DNS Server. Incoming traffic from the internet does not seem to utilize the internal DNS server. Is there a way to make incoming traffic get direction from my internal DNS?
 In fact, it seems like my DNS records do nothing for redirecting incoming traffic.

I wanted something with group management and OU hierarchies that sort of follow what you would use in Active Directory. I found a lot of issues with some of the more well recommended solutions out there:
  
Samba: It&#x27;s basically an AD Domain Controller which was more than I needed; also while being feature-familiar with AD is nice, I&#x27;m not looking to implement AD, I&#x27;m looking to really stick closer to just LDAP.
 GLAuth: Interesting project, but is somewhat limited in the attributes it can handle, how group management works, how the OU structure is reflected in group membership, and usability. GLauth-ui is an interesting component …</span>

                    <span>Hey, not sure if this is the right place, but Im not sure how to google this without getting noise. I&#x27;m currently running Ubuntu as a VM on a mac mini. On that VM, i have about 20 docker containers running, including (but not limited too) Home assistant, Node Red, Pihole, Heimdal, Grocy, Organizr, Portainer, Grafana, InfluxDB, Zwave2Mqtt, ESPHome and some others.
 ​
 This afternoon, Im no longer able to access any of the web addresses, the folders shared via samba, or even SSH into the virtual machine. I can still access it on my virtual box when connecting to the mac mini. I&#x27;ve tried restarting and shutting down the VM, and even restarting services. Any idea what other options exist to try and get these functioning?
 I should mention that the docker containers are definitely running. And i can access home assistant through nabucasa. And automations and alexa integrations still work. I just can&#x27;t access any services using the VM IP or Samab or SSH
 Never had to troubleshoot linux like this before. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks for any ideas and help.

                    <span>Hello fellow self-hosters,One of my hobbies is model railroading, and I was thinking how nice it would be if I had some kind of application / database where I could track all the different models, track pieces, etc. that are in my collection. This way I could keep track things like the buy date, price, information / description and age of the various models and accessories.
 Does anyone know of self-hosted software that would achieve this?
 I figured a finances manager, like firefly iii can be used to track the items as assets, but it would be nice if there&#x27;s something more specific for this use case.

 Have multiple ios devices using photo sync to send files to local computer. 
 Android devices are using nextcloud to send to nas. 
 Wife goes through her ios photos and moves them to her folders and then those are synced to nas with syncthing.
 Nextcloud files are synced to local computer using syncthing.
 Everything is then backed up weekly to backup drives. 
 I would like an easier way of doing all this, but not sure if there is one?
 Looking to keep orginal quality and all the Metadata.

                    <span>Hi everyone !
 I&#x27;m very exited to share with you how how I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps left by the death of google play music : the lack of possibility to synchronize playlists in an efficient way
 As google play music user my main usage was to upload my music and use it to download albums, artists or playlistson my mobile. Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.
 The solution I&#x27;m presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn&#x27;t put all my brain cells into it)).
 What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)
 You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync
 I&#x27;m really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)
 I hope it will be useful to some people. Whether it&#x27;s using the solution I propose or a solution based on the same principle but better suited to your own needs.
 I am of course open to all discussions and suggestions.
 PS : I&#x27;m not a native english speaker, I do my best.

 Not self hosted.
 So basically you get the benefit of selfhosted without all the technical stuff.

                    <span>title, I&#x27;ve been working on this on-off the last 2 years, but most progress was made the last year (lockdown amiright).
 The point is to scan your local NSFW videos &amp; images and provide a way to organize all of that stuff. Makes it easy to search for specific content (unwatched scenes, bookmarks, ratings etc) (like: &quot;show me all videos I&#x27;ve never watched featuring blondes&quot; or whatever). Media can then be accessed by any device with a web browser.
 The app supports videos (scenes), actors/actresses, movies, studios (including substudios, networks), images and scene chapters (markers). Future versions will also support image albums.
 It scales very nicely, doesn&#x27;t matter if you just have a couple of files or 10s of TB of data.

                    <span>Hi
 I am lookign for a self-hosted app that has good random photo features like creating clickable random gallery / picture wall from the root folder or from the current gallery. 
  
It can create random gallery on demand
 It can create random gallery based on the currently open gallery
 It can access to the local files (so no database import)
  
I use Piwigo for this but the random stuff is very limited, and it pulls from the root albums so %95 of the the time that is not what I need. Also it does not look like there is a way to number of photo shown, it is a fixed number.
 I do not want to use static page generators since I need this stuff to be generated on demand, static page gens are useless in this case.
 thanks

                    <span>I mainly do backend engineering involving few languages (but mostly Go).
 Right now i am trying to learn svelte as my FE framework. 
 My end goal is to become a good architect/devops and i have read it requires me to have full understanding of the whole architecture frontend/backend/cicd/server, etc. 
 So i was wondering if running selfhost apps allows me to sharpen my skill in the cicd and mnaging server part or even other than that.
 If someone has experience with this and how it affects their career and skills on this department, please do share with me

                    <span>I&#x27;m setting up a new home server and before I can get anything done I need to solve a unknown ssh issue.
 Heres the issue.
 ssh PC ---&gt; New Server : ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh PC ----&gt; Old server: works
 ssh Old Server ----&gt; New Server: works
 ssh Mobile phone ----&gt; New Server: works
 ssh New Server----&gt; Old Server: works
 ssh Old Server---&gt; PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Refused This makes sense
 ssh New Server ---&gt; PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh Mobile ----&gt;PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Restarting all the machines involved
 Restarting the ssh client on the new server
 Turning off all the firewalls (PC and New Server)
 Enabling ssh on UFW
 Tried Reinstalling the ssh client on the new server (This changed the fingerprint, but the old server could still connect to get the changed host error)
 Pinging the New Server from the PC works. Same ping as to the old one.
  
Things I&#x27;ve done to the new server:
  
Apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade
 apt install nvidia-headless-460-server
 echo &quot;blacklist floppy&quot; | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-floppy.conf Do to an I/O error I dont&#x27;t have a floppy
  
That&#x27;s it. That is all I&#x27;ve done since a clean install on bare metal. The whole thing is running on a btrfs file system if that matters. I haven&#x27;t enabled any encryption or anything else yet.
 This ssh service on the new server logs events for the clients that work but nothing at all coming from the PC. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea why it isn&#x27;t working. I didn&#x27;t test the ssh prior to the three changes above so I do not know if this was an issue previously.
 Both the old and the new server are running off the same installation image of Ubuntu server 20.04
 I would really like to get this working since I almost exclusively interact with the server using VScode on the PC.

                    <span>Hey always been wondering this, and google doesn&#x27;t yield an answer.
 For fpm docker images, what&#x27;s the difference between images that use alpine and those that don&#x27;t?
 I&#x27;m aware that alpine is one of the leanest containers out there, but is there any drawback from using alpine in production?
 If not, then why don&#x27;t all apps just skip fpm and go straight for fpm-alpine instead of giving the option for non alpine?

                    <span>Hi ! 
 I am looking for a simple web dashboard where I can add buttons and configure each of them to send a custom HTTP request.
 Is there such a thing available ?
 (Preferably big buttons kinda like the shortcut app on iOS)

 Does anybody know such a system?
 Thanks in advance for any tips!

                    <span>So i have decided to re-setup my self hosted services. Runs under docker with traefik(1.7) as a reverse proxy/ssl provider (lets encrypt). traefik has a middle ware thing called traefik-forward-auth that allows you to tap into an oauth provider to secure your services. One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.
 I don&#x27;t like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I&#x27;m being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.
 I&#x27;m curious how other people have this set up?
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

                    <span>This is all my setup I went through over a few days of trial and error to get myself a proper sandbox&#x27;d environment for my cameras.
 I have multiple Reolink cameras connected by a PoE switch to my Raspberry pi, which acts as a DHCP server for them and runs Shinobi as the cam software.
 All camera viewing then has to be performed through the Shinobi software, which is hosted instead off my local subnet.
 The trick is utilizing the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s wifi module + its ethernet port, allowing you to sandbox off the cameras to the Ethernet subnet (and thus requires a direct physical connection to access their data), and then view the camera footage over the wifi subnet (through your home router)
 I also have a NGINX configured reverse proxy server I use, as I have a website domain I host my stuff off of, which lets me access shinobi from anywhere (but requires login of course)

 I thought I would only remain a spectator of this community but today, I need your help ! 
 I&#x27;ve setup a NGinx Proxy Manager (Click here if you&#x27;re interested about it)
 With this reddit post : i&#x27;ve added authelia to NGinx (with the help of this post ) and it works fine with user/pass 
 but now, i&#x27;m planning to add DUO / OTP, but .. i don&#x27;t know why it just doesn&#x27;t work ! I can&#x27;t find where to activate it for my user
 here is my users_database.yml and configuration.yml
 https://pastebin.com/raw/iMXEyuPf
 ​
 i&#x27;ve tried to modify &quot;one_factor&quot; with &quot;two_factor&quot; but when it asks me DUO/OTP and I registering myself, i got this error :

 I was thinking of a Kanban board of some kind. Maybe one board for each room and each big item could be a &quot;ticket&quot; (sofa/fridge etc). Then I could have To Buy/Bought/Delivered for each column and drag each item as needed. Suggestions for each item could be added as comments.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Or is there any other way people could think to organise something like this? I would love it if there were metadata that could be assigned to each item, so I could have a cost associated to a ticket then for each room I could see how much has been spent etc.
 Whatever solution has to be able to support images on tickets. Ideally I have to get my fiance to use and if the UI is not somewhat pretty/modern I know for a fact she won&#x27;t use it, no matter how good it is. I’m not sure on Kanban because I need mobile for this and from what I’ve seen a lot of them aren’t responsive on an iPhone.

                    <span>Hi there - I&#x27;m pretty new to things like this but I was wondering if anyone may be able to help me.
 Say I have a webapp and I&#x27;m using something like localhost.run to expose this app that&#x27;s running on my local port 5000.
 I run something like:
 ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 localhost.run 
 and now have a nice little link like:
 https://081e35c0012dd4.localhost.run 
 that I can share with the world. This seems nice, but also very insecure. Is it possible to secure this a bit more - namely without needing to self host my own server. In this case localhost.run is taking a lot of the work out of maintaining my own server and things are quite easy.
 One of my use cases is testing webhooks. For example, say the webhooks I&#x27;m testing publish which IP addresses you can expect the requests to be coming from. How would I go about allowlisting only these IP addresses to access my newly exposed app, if at all possible?
 Thanks!

                    <span>I am planing to create a network with multiple webservices. A reverse proxy should take care of redirecting external incoming request to the appropriate webserver. But I am unsure about the internal clients. Should they also use the reverse proxy (Variant 1) or connect directly to the webservers (Variant 2)?
 What is your best practice?
 How do you handle certificates?
 I am fan of having the same url for external and internal clients and using offical CAs (like LetsEncrypt) for internal FQDNs. Thanks anyone for your feedback.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been happily running all my selfhosted stuff on a headless Ubuntu Server using VirtualBox for almost a decade now. While I&#x27;ve got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there&#x27;s newer tech that is far more convenient. I&#x27;m super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) &amp; allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I&#x27;m not even aware of! I&#x27;m less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.
 ​
 While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh &amp; the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!
 ​
 I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I&#x27;m under the impression that the default used to be K8 &amp; Docker &amp; Ansible, but now it seems that K8 &amp; Docker don&#x27;t play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?
 ​
 Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management. I also run LDAP (not whole home) &amp; 3 node Galera Cluster (HA MariaDB).

                    <span>Hi,
 We are using OnlyOffice self hosted but only as groupware email solution - we have around 100 users, and every user has 2-5 external mailboxes connected via imap to external mail server. OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:
  
Nextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).
 Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.
 Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.
 Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. 
 Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don&#x27;t want to move mx&#x27;es to our new self hosted.
  
So, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:
  
Create users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.
 Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.
 Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.
 It&#x27;s ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.
  
Many thanks for any suggestions!

                    <span>Has anyone tried running a selfhosted instance of notebook.ai? From their readme it seems like you&#x27;re meant to run it on your machine just for development. They do have a Dockerfile, but it seems to also be just for local dev.
 Does anyone run it? How is the performance? Did you have to use AWS s3 or does it store files locally?

                    <span>My friends are finally considering moving away from Discord after recent drama, and I&#x27;ve been searching for a suitable program for a few months. I have looked at and rejected Mattermost (doesn&#x27;t have the permissions I need) and Rocket.Chat (has half the permissions but runs too slow). 
 What I really need is a chat server that can be used to restrict file uploads to specific rooms or user roles, and, at the very least, has the capability to create an &#x27;arrivals&#x27; system, where users show up to a single room before being invited to the chat at large. My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don&#x27;t want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. 
 I&#x27;m currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it&#x27;s unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.

                    <span>If you haven&#x27;t used it, Tailscale solves so many problems with connectivity / port forwarding / security. Run it on all your machines and log in, and they&#x27;re all connected and their hostnames resolve (i.e. http://mycomputer:8080). It solves One Problem, with absolutely zero config headache. I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don&#x27;t mind that Tailscale isn&#x27;t fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way
 It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you&#x27;d want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)
 I have no association with the project btw, I&#x27;m solely an extremely happy free-tier user

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

Ubuntu server &#x3D;&gt; Ubuntu server
 
 The server does have a 450 Mbits uplink connection and I&#x27;m looking for a program that actually uses the full bandwidth of the uplink, with parallel connections automatically. So, if you initiate a transfer, it should really saturate the uplink with as many parallel connections until the 450 Mbits bandwidth is used to the fullest.

                    <span>So I decided to setup an XMPP server and was surprised how simple it was. I&#x27;ve tried hosting email, cloud storage etc... before but the XMPP service I used called Prosody was super straight forward. I wrote up the basic steps if anyone was considering getting off private messaging apps.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
