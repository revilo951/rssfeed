                    <span>Hi guys!
 My electricity sometimes cuts off for a few seconds, and it&#x27;s enough for my pi 4 to brutally reboot.
 In order to prevent this, is a powerbank kept attached to the electric plug enough, with the pi 4 plugged on it? Or should I get an actual UPS?
 In either case, which model do you advise?
 Many thanks to anyone who helps :)

                    <span>Hi,
 My NAS&#x27; motherboard is an Asrock j4105-itx. I can use wake on LAN to power up the NAS, that&#x27;s great. But if the NAS has been sent to suspend, the magic packet won&#x27;t power up the NAS.
 I&#x27;m thinking that a workaround could be to use hibernate instead of suspend, the rare times I need to make sure the NAS is all quiet.
 But is my problem a common thing among people who use WOL?
 Thank you.

                    <span>I&#x27;m setting up a WikiJS with Keycloak. Keycloak says it generally sits behind a reverse proxy, so I was wondering if that is standard practice. Do people generally apply the HTTPS and the LetsEncrypt certificate on say an Nginx proxy, or should it be applied directly to Keycloak/WikiJS?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve had all my docker containers in the Synology&#x27;s docker app with their data in bind mounts. It was easy to backup because it was just file system folders and files.
 Now I&#x27;ve made the jump to Ubuntu server (I&#x27;m a Linux novice) and installed all my favorites containers there.
 Most of them are with bind mounts, but I was forced to make a docker volume for a Postgres database.
 I&#x27;ve read that volumes are the recommended way to store persistent data.
 Can you guys help me understand and answer the following, please?
  
Should I only work with volumes and not bind mounts?
 How do I easily and automatically take a backup of my container data (preferably to my NAS)?
 Is it something like https://hub.docker.com/p/loomchild/volume-backup or https://hub.docker.com/r/futurice/docker-volume-backup? Can you recommend something else?
 How do you edit various files in the volumes, when the data is located in /var/lib/docker/volumes/, and you have to sudo all the time? I would prefer to have the folder mounted in something like Visual Studio Code, but I don&#x27;t have access with my user (without sudo).
  
Thanks!

                    <span>Hello everybody,
 I recently setup heimdall. And decided to as I do with all my other sites set it to go thru my nginx reverse proxy. But there is a weird thing, when I try to visit it it gives me an items and apps button and a login button. But these all redirect to http://127.0.0.1:8888(Port of heimdall).
 Do you guys have any idears what could cause this as this only happens when it&#x27;s being directed thru my reverse proxy. As when I just go straight to the IP from my PC it works.
 (My setup)Heimdall port 8888 set to 80 on the container port.Nginx reverse proxy with the below settings.
 server {
 listen 80;
 server_name subdomain.domain.xyz;
 ​
 location / {
 proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
 }
 }
 And it gives the below problem

 ​
 Edit: I was able to fix it by switching from NGINX to Caddy which i had wanted to do for a long time so win win I guess.

                    <span>Hi All, 
 I have been working for a while on a side project I call Photostore. Photostore is a self-hosted mobile photo/video backup solution. Kind of like a really boiled down version of Google Photos (without machine learning or any public cloud connectivity). There are two parts to the app:
  
The frontend - written in Flutter which compiles to iOS, Android and Web. 
 The backend - a Python/FastAPI API server app that can be configured with a Postgres or SQLite DB. (Dockerfile provided in the project)
  
So far the Photostore app has the ability to: 
  
Backup mobile photos and view mobile photos for multiple devices (each device is identified by a custom identifier defined per device)
 Mobile videos can be backed up as well, but can not currently be played through the app
 All server p…</span>

                    <span>I have turned an old PC that I had at home into a small Nextcloud Server (running on Ubuntu) It works fine, but when there is a blackout (they are kind of frequent in my area) it shuts down (obviously) and doesn’t turn on again when electricity is back.
 Since I’m often far from home (where this server is) I would like it to turn on automatically (or remotely) when electricity is back, so that I won’t need always someone to do it physically. 
 Any idea on how to achieve this? How did you solved this problem with your servers?

I want to be able to assign each students paperwork to a profile for them so that I have the ability to search the student name and pull up their paperwork. I tired looking into some student information systems but it seems like it may be a little much for what I want. If anyone has any suggestions that would be great!

                    <span>Heya folks,
 Just posted the first rev of wireguard-initramfs for debian bullseye.
 This enables you to setup a wireguard network during kernel init, enabling remote crypt FS unlocking via dropbear over wireguard, removing the need to expose ports or services on the remote network; additionally this enables you to create a remote box that is fully encrypted with no local key material outside of the boot wireguard client private key.
 Hope someone else finds this useful!

                    <span>Happy 4th of July to all of my American Self Hosters! 
 Does anyone know of a sequencing software where you could create a fireworks show with a visual preview? 
 I have thought about using something like Vixen to do this, but there is no preview of what the show would look like, and the use case for that software is for holiday lights. 
 Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you!

                    <span>Does anyone here use the free tier of Google Cloud or Oracle Cloud, where they basically give you a VPS with an IPv4 address - does that work for SMTP and can you set up custom reverse DNS records?
 I am currently using a VPS at vultr for that, but as other services that ran on the VPS are no longer needed, I am looking for a free/cheaper alternative (but I&#x27;d like to keep a custom reverse DNS record).

 I self host a rocketchat instance and I&#x27;m interested in finding a bot framework to use with it write a bot.
 hubot appears to possbly be abandoned ( not sure )
 the Rocketchat bot tutorials depend on botkit.ai ... which was sold to Microsoft, so now you can&#x27;t get an API key for it.
 thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to build a homeNAS. I&#x27;ve been using synology but I wasn&#x27;t too happy and I think I&#x27;ll roll my own. So far I can achieve the following:
  
I am leaning towards Arch Linux (have used Ubuntu, Void, Artix but liked Arch based in terms of lightweightedness and customizability).
 
I can install root on ZFS and add other storages on ZFS. I can manually set up snapshot cycles using sanoid.
 
whatever complicated software I want to run, I run in docker if possible.
 
I have tried TrueNAS Scale, and 21.06 beta isn&#x27;t quite ready yet.
 
 I, however, am not going to dig around in CLI and config file all day long. I have a few things I&#x27;d prefer to have some &quot;service&quot; running on web GUI if possible.
 Things are: 4. Web-based file manager. I use TinyFileManager or FileRun 5. docker management. I use portainer. 6. server health monitoring. i can use cockpit.
 Things I&#x27;m looking for:
 A. I really would like to ask for advice for a KVM-QEMU web-based admin, kinda like virt-manager, but run totally on the web interface with display on web-VNC--like what TrueNAS Scale or Synology DSM offers. I&#x27;m looking at this list from KVM site and would appreciate any pointers.
 B. Web GUI to manage my scheduled snapshots (commanding sanoid basically).
 I&#x27;d appreciate any recommendation for solving A &amp; B above.
 Thanks a lot for any advice in advance! Cheers!

                    <span>I currently use Jellyfin using docker to stream my media on other devices at home. I would soon need this media to be accessible through remote connections. 
 The main problem that I&#x27;m facing right now is that my ISP does not support port forwarding.
 Questions:
  
Will using a VPN on my machine help me enable remote connections? 
 If so, which VPN should I consider for free(at least initially) use? 
 Would it cause any issues if I later switch to reverse proxy (for adding Nextcloud)?
 
 I also read somewhere that I can use an ec2 instance to route my traffic through ssh. Is this possible? Any drawbacks, experiences?
  
If VPN, ec2 traffic routing is not the solution to this, is there an alternative?
 [Sorry for the newbie questions, couldn&#x27;t find many articles on it]

                    <span>Currently i am using matrix. But recently i found out that the protocol leaks a lot of metadata and most of it ends up at matrix.org and vector.im . This concerns me and i don&#x27;t think i will be using matrix until this is solved.
 Other alternatives are XMPP but i hate the fact that the clients seems so incompatible with each other. I know of snikket but i don&#x27;t like the fact that it runs in docker(but i would use it if i have to) and they don&#x27;t have a desktop client yet. There is also signal, but they are turning a bit shady these days when they hid commits for a year. And also despite being open source, to self host signal is extremely hard, which i don&#x27;t like. And also the crypto currency stuff surrounding signal.
 The only other alternative i know of is a fork of matrix(called Grid) that is currently only a protocol specification.
 What else can i use?

                    <span>I want to compress all my images (by lowering the quality or resolution) and transcode all my videos. I also want to be able to do this regulars for videos and images that are backed up.
 Is there a good way to do it? 
 I&#x27;ve read about Tdarr but from what I&#x27;ve read it is only for videos. I&#x27;d prefer to use one solution for both actions or to hear about a solution for images and I&#x27;ll use both.
 Thanks!

                    <span>I have a remote (Digital Ocean) server with a fast internet connection. I have a openvpn server set up so I can connect my devices when traveling.
 Often I&#x27;m on slow local hotel/countryside wifi connection so I can&#x27;t benefit from the fast server-side internet link, being limited by the local speed.
 Is it possible to set up some type of MITM compression on the server (like Opera or Google do/used to to) where pages are compressed on the server before being sent to the client?
 Problem I see is that with webpages being https, the server can&#x27;t downscale images etc that take up the most bandwidth.
 Any ideas? Or just not possible?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to find a web editor that looks like MS Word and saves as Markdown or LaTeX files. With &quot;looks like MS Word&quot; I mean that it only shows the &quot;rendered&quot; file and allows you to edit it without showing any language specific syntax.
 It&#x27;s going to be used by my parents and some other older family members so the more it works like what they know (in this case MS Word) the better. I would like to avoid getting calls about &quot;asterisks appearing when I make something bold&quot; if possible
 Should be selfhosted and preferably it should save the files on the server but I can work around this point if need be.
 Thanks

                    <span>This is probably not news to most of you pros but if not, here you go. 
 Docker will bypass UFW firewall by default. 
 See this article for details and how to fix. 
 I was going crazy trying to figure out why my server was so slow and why the load averages were so high. I was, unknowingly, running a crypto miner. I felt okay to play since I thought I was behind UFW and a Caddy reverse proxy. I guess not so much!

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve been using nginx proxy manager on Home assistant, but every time i put on a new host and use a cloudflare/let&#x27;s encrypt SSL the configuration points to the dummy cert. Is there a way to make it right? I&#x27;ve tried to remove the dummy cert file but that make the container to not go up.

                    <span>Hi,First time poster to this sub so excuse me if I break any rules.
 I&#x27;ve been working on my own Home Dashboard and I was wondering what the best way to get map tiles off of OpenStreetMap/Leaflet providers for offline viewing, I&#x27;ve tried scripts but those are too slow or result in a block from the server. Would anyone here know how to download map tiles for offline viewing, tried searching online but can&#x27;t find anything.
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m looking for a vpn to access my local network resources remotely. I was using pritunl but it&#x27;s too slow and doesn&#x27;t have very many good docker containers. I did like that pritunl had an easy to configure gui. Looking for something that preferably can be run as an easy to deploy docker container. Thanks for any and all insight.

 I want to be able to see how an annual subscription translates into a monthly pay and viceversa for example, and see how much I spend both monthly/annually, too.
 I was looking into Firefly III earlier but couldn&#x27;t see anything about this, does anyone have an idea?

                    <span>I&#x27;m thinking maybe syncthing, but I really dislike web UIs or GUIs in general for setting these things up. Plain-text config files are easier to maintain and to deploy automatically.
 Is there an alternative that would allow me to have 2-3 clients to two-way sync files from a subset of the folders in the main server? Preferably a low-configuration alternative, where a short config file can specify the server IP and which folders I want to sync and where to store them in the client. Handling file history for some folders (server configuration) is a nice bonus.
 If this is possible with syncthing can someone point me to some good resources?
 Thanks in advance!
 ETA: FOSS is preferred :)

                    <span>I&#x27;ve built up a few bare metal boxes over the years that serve me well. A media server here, server with containers there, a NAS in the corner, etc. I quite like this set up because they are tucked away where no one can hurt them or spill anything on them, except when I need to reinstall something or troubleshoot with a keyboard and monitor. Can&#x27;t do much about the latter, but I&#x27;m curious what my options are for installing Ubuntu on a headless server are? I&#x27;ve used Ansible to configure them post install, but never used anything like pxe or Ubuntu auto install before. Always stuck a USB into the device and did it manually. Any ideas?

 My husband and I are big fans of those old SingStar games for PS2, and I was wondering if anyone has anything similar that we can selfhost? We like being able to have the lyrics scroll, and a gamification aspect like rating vocal input to a microphone would be awesome! :P
 Thank you so much! :)

 any questions or feedback feel free to ask, i figured if i&#x27;m competent enough to understand what&#x27;s going on others probably will too but i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m awful at explaining bits, but i want to learn how to FOSS in this manner more anyway. 
 my instance is hosted from a shitty old laptop running ubuntu 4c/4t, with data off a usb3 ssd, it&#x27;s plenty fast even over wan. 
 hope this gives someone more fun ideas!

 &quot;If you want to add your game directory so it serves content to your users you need to do the following:
  
Add the dir to your web server
 Generate an index with this script, save it inside the folder you want to serve https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS/blob/master/tools/XHRIndexer.coffee
 Add a new mount in the setupFileSystem function, look for the xfs blocks and unconmment them and tweak them accordingly&quot;
  
My problem is I can&#x27;t find the XHRIndexer.coffee to do this
 I would like to probably write my own little tutorial after I get this set up to help others since documentation and general information about this whole thing is pretty sparse.
 Any help is greatly appreciated

                    <span>Anyone know if any self-hosted solutions for following certain IMDb pages? e.g. certain movie title, or actor. I tried to search for people using IMDbpy but couldn&#x27;t find anything for tracking specific titles/actors. Mostly people use full IMDb data sets and API for pulling either all info, or for &quot;I have watched this&quot; lists.
 Would love to one day find something that&#x27;ll be able to send a notification:
 -Keanu Reeves got added to Matrix 5
 -Matrix 5 release date set for xx/xx/xx
 I think the official app allows you to follow and get the notifications, but would like to not rely on Amazon&#x27;s app for this one.

                    <span>This might be a bit hard to explain, but I&#x27;m basically looking for something like DEVONagent/Google Alerts/Visualping, etc.
 I have a couple webpages I&#x27;d like to monitor for any changes, and a couple search queries that I&#x27;d like to run every once in a while and get a list of new results, etc.
 Is there something I could self-host like that?

                    <span>Hey guys, does anyone know if a self hosted golf app that I can use on my phone and will sync back to my NAS? I don&#x27;t need much - scores / putts and a handicap calculator would be amazing. Currently using swingu - used to be swing x swing.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve decided to start chasing my old dream of having all my data &quot;in the cloud&quot; and accessed uniformly across my devices but without relying on infrastructure that is not in my control.
 Today I have some of it on a dedicated server running a Pydio instance, I have been pondering moving 100% of my data there (documents and media) but that got me thinking about the current pain points:
  
Pydio: Pydio is reliable but functionality is not great and I don&#x27;t like the mobile app.
 Backup: My backups are handled by custom scripts that I am not fully happy with and are a pain to restore.
 Availability: I am dependent on that one server being up. If there is any issue with it, I am screwed out of my files.
  
I would like to get a second server that can remain up while the other one is down. Ultimately, I would like it to be able to scale so that I have a third server at home, and not have to change anything to the infrastrucure.
 So in essence, I am asking for a scalable distributed filesystem that would handle replication transparently across the nodes and abstract the storage so that I can either access it in an unique way from various cloud storage server instances (e.g. NextCloud) or by mounting it directly from my client home machines.
 Right now I am looking at object storage like OpenIO, CEPH or MinIO, however I get the feeling that they are intended for high performance servers and what I have may not cut it, especially with regards to network latency.
 I don&#x27;t need high performance when writing, but I would like to be able to stream video from it; so if the solution can do full replication instead of striping, that would allow streaming from the local node only and we should be good.
 Am I looking in the right direction? Anyone attempting such an architecture?

                    <span>Hi,
 I´m looking for a &quot;nice&quot; manager for some links, like an UI in which you can manage redirect links so it is a webserver which you can connect to your domain via A-Record so I can easily create a redirect from thisservice/sample to sample.invalid.
 EDIT: clarification: I want this to be accessible from WAN
 Thank you

                    <span>Hi self-hosters,
 I&#x27;m looking for a self-hosted replacement for the likes of Emma and Yolt here in the UK. I&#x27;ve looked at Firefly III but understandably it cannot support syncing from any bank/credit card around the world.
 ​
 Did anybody solve this well?
 Is there a community maintained set of integrations for Firefly III I could tap into and contribute?
 ​
 I hate having my transaction records synced to a third party company I do not trust, and I need the automation of categorization these apps give. So time to solve this properly.

                    <span>New release:
 A few days ago we released a new version of Wiretrustee, v0.0.8. This version brings two major improvements and OS support for Windows:
 Performance improvements:
  
Wiretrustee can detect peers in the same internal network or with public IPs without restricted NAT, and it will connect Wireguard peers directly without the need for a local go-proxy.
 Kernel Wireguard detection. The native Wireguard (shipped with Linux as a kernel module) will be used if available.
  
Windows support
  
Added windows service installation
  
The documentation was updated to guide you through the Windows support. As we are using https://www.wintun.net/ to manage the interface, the client needs to be executed as a service, so we decided to add the service command which includes the install, stop, …</span>

                    <span>I had been using Seafile as my WebDAV server for Joplin. I decided to use FileRun exclusively. WebDAV works, I can access it from a variety of applications and operating systems. However Joplin doesn&#x27;t appear to like it. I suspect it&#x27;s the &quot;@Home&quot; in the WebDAV URL. I have also tried &quot;%40Home&quot; and get a different error when I sync. When I click on &quot;Check Synchronization Configuration&quot; in Joplin I see success. It&#x27;s when I synchronize that I see errors.

 The &quot;@Home&quot; URL...

A NAS wouldn&#x27;t be great, due to the USB 2.0 ports. I do have a couple small OLED displays kicking around I could wire up to it maybe, displaying stats of some kind? I guess I could move my PiHole install back over to it maybe? 
 Anything outside the box anyone can suggest that it could do, even with the low specs by today&#x27;s standards?
 Thanks!

 I should add, something relatively easy to deploy / maintain would be great.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a homelab enthusiast. Not a network engineer. I pretty good with reverse proxies, vm&#x27;s, and containers. Possibly because I&#x27;m bored and want to learn new tools and information I&#x27;m interested in learning about HA setups. I&#x27;ve tinkered with Docker Swarm, however it seems most of the information on web is really focused on K8s. I&#x27;ve recently watched a lot videos on Consul and K3s and it seems like a lot of the concepts with these setups are the same. I&#x27;m struggling however with terminology, ingress controllers and honestly with a lot of examples pulling in things that aren&#x27;t explained very well -- such as manifests and service files. What are some good resources to learn about this technology? I&#x27;m not opposed for paying for courses. K3s seems to be possibly more applicable for homelab than K8s since I don&#x27;t need all the cloud technology backed into the software however I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m even asking the right questions.
 Thanks for any opinions and comments regarding resources I should consult.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a large USB drive I want to use as local network storage for Windows and Linux devices, is there a decent OS or app I can use that has a web GUI and can do all the mounting and sharing through there?
 I&#x27;m basically looking for anything easier than having to manually write fstab rules and modify samba settings on Ubuntu haha 
 Unfortunately don&#x27;t have a network sharing option on my router.

                    <span>So I’m running Ombi and Plex, for myself and my family consistently, as well as some fun things here and there from this subreddit as things pop up. Also I run chrome Remote Desktop so that I can monitor and tinker remotely when I have downtime at work. But in the last month, I’ve come home to see my gpu at 100% usage, and the first time the person had it set to disable when in use, so I only noticed it because I have AIDA64 on a mini monitor and digging through task manager I found they had installed an exe in a public folder. The second time it happened was yesterday. I noticed the usage, immediately went through all the steps to remove it again, but there it was in a public folder. 
 With that said how can I have all these things that are connected or connectable outside my home network without the risk of those same ports being used by nefarious people?
 At this point I’ve killed all access and locked down my firewall. But what can I do differently, or is this just the risk that comes with all that?
 The worst part is after the first time I installed Acronis True Image which offers cryptojacking protection specifically. Needless to say it was completely useless in preventing the second attack. 
 I’m sorry if this is not a good place for this, but I feel like someone new to self-hosting, could also experience these seem attacks.
 EDIT 1: Followed a ton of advice about killing rdp. Did that. Somehow- this person connected again, via power shell and did their thing and installed their stuff again.
 This is with glasswire, windows firewall and Acronus protection all running and nothing caught it. WTH!

                    <span>Hello everyone, this month I added two new features to Rofolia which is a self-hosted collaborative database/spreadsheet hybrid. It is meant as a self-hosted alternative to Airtable or Google Sheets.
 - Dropdown select column: Choose one or more choices from a group of options. Also useful to group rows by.
 - Date &amp; Time column types: Set dates with or without a time, in various different formats.
 ​
 Rofolia also supports:
 - Real time collaboration
 - Linking records between tables and creating links from existing values
 - Grouping and sorting, including nested grouping
 - Applying formulas per row
 - Api access for reading and writing
 Try it out at: https://rofolia.com
 This walkthrough shows most of the available features in action: https://rofolia.com/power_demo.html

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to self hosting and I&#x27;m looking to upgrade from my Raspberry Pi 4 to a server based on x86_64 architecture.
 I feel slightly overwhelmed with all the options (which is a good thing I guess) there are. I believe a mini server would fit my needs well, as I want to mount it under my desk I use daily.
 Could you please guide me into what kind of server (feel free to recommend me any) I should take a look at, given the following:
  
private use (small user base: around 3 users)
 as small as possible, as I want to mount it under my desk (mini server)
 silent, as I want to mount it under my desk (I prefer a server without fans, as long as cooling is sufficient)
 energy efficient, as it should operate 24/7 (small energy footprint)
 m.2 ssd (I don&#x27;t want to use a hdd at all, given how cheap ssds are nowadays)
 network interface that supports 1000 Mbit/s
 ubuntu (this might change) as the os
 every service should run from a docker container: NextCloud, Portainer, Plex Media Server, PiHole, Bitwarden, Papermerge etc.
 server will be exposed through a reverse proxy such as npm
 budget: up to 400€ (I don&#x27;t think I will need to spend this amount, given my requirements are low)
 as a reference: the Pi 4 (had a hdd connected to it) was &quot;ok&quot; performance wise. I prefer the x86_64 architecture though and would like more performance :)
  
​
 I&#x27;m fine building the server myself. I&#x27;m also fine buying a used one.

                    <span>A few months I decided to switch out my cloud-connected Blink cameras with a self-hosted solution. The Blink cameras work by recording clips for motion events only. I wanted to achieve the same thing only without reliance on the cloud (and battery power).
 I went shopping for POE cameras and ordered a few Reolink RLC-410-5MP. These are well priced and seemed to be fairly well regarded. I then set out looking at NVR software options. The main contenders I could see in this space were Blue Iris, Zone Minder, and Shinobi. For what I wanted to achieve though, these all seemed overkill.
 In the meantime, the cameras arrived and I quickly discovered that these Reolink cameras have their own in-built motion detection and are able to upload clips to an FTP server upon detection. This made me think…</span>

                    <span>I currently host some files on OneDrive and Google Drive, but I&#x27;d much rather self-host it, maintaining a live backup on backblaze B2.
 My plan is a rclone cronjob running a frequent backup to backblaze(few times an hour), but I&#x27;m a bit afraid about whether it will run into problems. For example if a drive dies, and I run an rclone sync. Does anyone have a better idea?
 I don&#x27;t want to access the files straight off of backblaze though, so I want to self-host cloud storage. I don&#x27;t need a lot of fancy features, the main thing I want is some kind of live syncing when you remove/add something to the directory, just like how dropbox, onedrive, and google drive do it. I guess I could technically just use samba in combination with a VPN for when I&#x27;m outside of the network, but I&#x27;d really rather have a more robust solution for when I don&#x27;t have VPN credentials handy.
 I&#x27;m running proxmox, I tried installing nextcloud in a container but I ran into some issues regarding permissions with the bind mount and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was right for me either.

 Now the credentials are valid and known good.. I&#x27;ve tried multiple users and I&#x27;ve even rebuilt the FreeIPA instance twice, no joy. Has anyone run into this issue before and happen to have a fix? I&#x27;m pretty new to LDAP so it&#x27;s been a lot of firing from the hip..

                    <span>When writing front-end tests, you’ll find a lot of pitfalls along the way. In sum, they can lead to lousy maintainability, slow execution time, and — in the worst case — tests you cannot trust. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this article, I will talk about common mistakes developers make, at least in my experience, and, of course, how to avoid them. Testing doesn’t need to be painful, after all.</span>

                    <span>How would you go about creating your own self-hosted style of &quot;DigitalOcean&quot;? I know you could easily create users/passwords and whatnot, but I would want users to be able to sudo all they want within their own sandbox. I&#x27;m looking at this more from a classroom training standpoint. At the end of the day just destroy all of them and recreate again. I&#x27;m wondering if you could mass deploy a bunch of LXCs in Proxmox perhaps?

                    <span>I use several selfhosted services but am having a lot of difficulty with the networking aspects
 It is frustrating that I am able to get most things running but do not have the skills or knowledge to fix them if they go wrong even slightly
 1: Mix of different devices and network equipment:
 A: Windows 10 PC with several shared drives in SMB B: ASUs router, 3 x Eero In Bridge mode, Virgin Cable router 200/50 mbit C: Virtualbox running Yunohost serving RSS-Bridge, Nitter and Searx - this is the most reliable part of them all to be fair D: Raspberry Pi 4 8gb running dietpi but really only used for PiHole at moment E: NUC running Plex Server F: Mainly Ios devices in the home G: No IOT devices H: Mullvad VPN running on main pc only at present - needed to mask torrent and bypass the isp blocks on some sites here 
 2: several services I would like to be able to connect to from outside the network- currently done via port forwarding through the ASU’s router but this seems very unreliable as well as insecure 
 3: example of Sonarr I am unable to access even on LAN from a different pc but can view with no issue on the Windows PC it runs on (Firewall is off and I have changed ports several times, Radarr works fine on same machine) 
 4: I do own a domain but it’s not being used right now
 5: Ideally I do not want to have to spend a lot more money fixing what I have already spent a lot on buying
 6: I am very open to suggestions on what to do to get this all into a better shape. Pretty comfortable in Windows but very much a beginner with Linux

                    <span>Title says most of it. I&#x27;m pretty new to this, I have a personal linux server set up (LAMP Stack, port forwarding 80 and 443, have a domain name that im pretty sure is pointing to my server) and I&#x27;m looking to host a website for my &quot;personal brand&quot;. I can load up the website fine on my home network via the domain name but once I go anywhere else, I cannot do a google search and pull my website up.
 Am I missing a step? Should I be trying a different approach? I&#x27;m just not sure lol
 Thank you in advance for reading this and giving my problem some thought, I greatly appreciate it :)

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m unhappy with Trello right now. I&#x27;m looking at Restya. I know it doesn&#x27;t have automatizations, but I guess what I need I can just do manually.
 What I&#x27;m curious about is what self-hosted means and how do I do it?
 like, is it, do I install it on my computer and android? I don&#x27;t understand, can I use it outside of my own computer and android? like can I use it on another computer if I have it on mine?
 Is it too hard for someone who doesn&#x27;t know about coding and all that to use? should I just stick with Trello?
 Thank you

                    <span>Hi everyone. I am looking for the best way to host eBook files (epub/pdf) and be able to read them from an iPad/iOS. What would be the best route? What I care about is metadata collection (name/cover etc) and that it will be able to save where I left off (not sure if this is a functionality of the server or the reading client).
 Thank you very much!

                    <span>I plan to have all my home-server&#x27;s services running in docker containers (except for NFS shares), and I believe I need to setup a reverse proxy to have multiple things accessible to the outside world. 
 I&#x27;m a little confused about how I should set things up with respect to my domain. Currently I have something like the following
 --- CURRENT --- mydomain.tld -&gt; gitlab pages cloud.mydomain.tld -&gt; nextcloud docker container --- PLANNED --- mydomain.tld -&gt; gitlab pages cloud.mydomain.tld -&gt; reverse proxy -&gt; internal IP address/port of nextcloud container other.mydomain.tld -&gt; reverse proxy -&gt; internal IP address/port of other container seconddomain.tld -&gt; undecided other.seconddomain.tld -&gt; reverse proxy -&gt; internal IP address/port of other2 container 
 I currently have both domain&#x27;s DNS handled via Cloudflare.
 Questions:
  
 Should the reverse proxy itself be a docker container or should it run directly on the os itself?
  Where should the Let&#x27;s Encrypt SSL cert generation be handled with respect to each domain/subdomain? 
 Handled in the reverse proxy?
 Handled within each of the respective containers?
 Something else?

 I&#x27;m very new to all of this so the more basic, the better! I&#x27;m trying to understand the process in having my own website. I want the website to store data. I heard wix is an option and I&#x27;ve heard the words &quot;servers&quot;, &quot;domains&quot;, &quot;AWS&quot; tossed around. All I really want to do is create my own site and store users data securely and understand what hardware I need to buy and what software I need to buy and what I need to learn if any coding is required. Not really sure if I&#x27;m making the question more complicated... but someone please enlighten me. Thank You.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve added docker-compose support (among other things) to https://github.com/horahoradev/horahora . 
 Horahora is a videohosting website facilitating content archival from other websites (Niconico, Bilibili, and YT). Users can specify categories of content they wish to archive from other websites, and the software will correctly sync content in that category to the intended storage backend (currently Backblaze) and database (postgres). This tool was designed in the interest of facilitating collaborative archival (e.g. many users collectively determine what to archive), but also supports local, single-user use.
 Usage instructions are included in the README. Discord is https://discord.gg/vfwfpctJRZ , feel free to bug me if things are broken or don&#x27;t make sense. There are many things to be improved (UI especially, I&#x27;m a weeabdev not a webdev), so I&#x27;d like to get a sense of how people want things to be prioritized.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure the title is clear, so give me a bit to explain what I mean.
 I&#x27;m familiar with the concepts of virtualization and containerization. I&#x27;m already running a couple of VMs and a few containers. I don&#x27;t need to read (again) what Docker is, and what it means for development.
 And yet... I don&#x27;t have the basic fundamental knowledge that most tutorials/blog posts/reference pages about self hosting stuff assumes it&#x27;s readers must already have. Which is a polite way of saying those authors really do not know how to teach.
 Now, let me be clear. I&#x27;m not asking any of you to provide answers/solutions to me. Your input is appreciated, and you are welcome to add it if you are so inclined. That just isn&#x27;t what I am asking for.
 I don&#x27;t mind reading, and even enjoy it. So if any one can poin…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve typically just been installing stuff I want to self host on my main PC, but lately I&#x27;ve been playing around with VirtualBox and I&#x27;m interesting in hosting a few things on VMs.
 I went to setup Nextcloud on a VM last night and I immediately ran into something I&#x27;m unsure about - what OS should I use? I don&#x27;t need fancy desktop environments or extra bloat like OS&#x27;s that come packaged with libreoffice, thunderbird, firefox, etc.
 For you guys self-hosting in VMs, how do you decide what OS to use? Is there an OS that&#x27;s generally seen as the go-to default OS for self-hosting apps on VMs? Or do you just pick something familiar like Ubuntu/CentOS and not worry about the extra bloat?

                    <span>Hello! I&#x27;m pretty new to the whole self-hosting thing, and I seem to have run into an issue. 
 I was installing Ubooquity, using the 5 minute installation guide here https://vaemendis.github.io/ubooquity-doc/pages/installation-guide.html 
 But after the .jar file installs all of the necessary folders and files, nothing happens. No desktop interface opens up. I&#x27;ve executed the Ubooquity.jar file a bunch of times, and nothing happens. 
 I&#x27;m either not doing something right myself, or something is wrong with either my setup or the program. 
 Any help would be much appreciated. I&#x27;ve tried looking for answers all over. 
 Here&#x27;s my log file:

                    <span>Like many of you, I&#x27;m using Nginx Proxy Manager. It been a great tool so far. What would be the best way to add basic monitoring and/or stats for the proxy? Just something like how many hits a proxy has gotten, errors, etc. Most of this data is in the logs, so really could just be a web GUI on top of that I suppose.
 From what I can tell, Nginx Proxy Manager is just a dressed up version of Nginx, so maybe just a standard plug-and-play nginx monitoring tool would work?
 It looks like Traefik has a bit more of this functionality built in, but I really like Nginx Proxy Manager and would rather not switch if I don&#x27;t have to.
 Thanks!
 edit: I&#x27;m running Nginx Proxy Manager in docker
 something like this could work...https://learn.netdata.cloud/guides/collect-apache-nginx-web-logs but I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;d need to mess with the log collector to run inside the nginx container, which doesn&#x27;t seem too great...but that may be unavoidable as any external monitoring solution (ie not native to nginx) would need access to the logs

                    <span>Hey guys n ladies! :)
 I‘ve a question related to this posts title.
 I set up a nextcloud server with a storage box on a Hetzner server. Working really good (went the docker way) and i like nextcloud pretty much.
 The main purpose i am using a VPS with a storage box is that my internet connection at home is pretty slow (80/15) regarding file transfer. If my upload would be better i would have hosted everything locally, maybe in the future.
 So i would like to have a bidirectional sync between my Nextcloud data and a local folder on my synology nas. This way all my files are in my local network and i could access them quickly because of gbit lan and on the other side i can access them quickly everywhere else because of the good upload speed from the VPS.
 And the main reason is also that if i change files locally, they can be synced to my nextcloud and vice versa.
 The only way i found would be WebDAV with Cloud Sync. But is that the best and only way?
 I tried also with a vpn connection and mount the nextcloud files folder to the nas and with sftp mount. Then with rsync, but thats not really working like i want to.
 Du you have some ideas?
 Greetings :)

                    <span>I want to host my own mail server in my home network, but have a dynamic DNS, no uptime guarantee, and in any case I definitely don&#x27;t want to expose it to the internet through port forwarding.
 I was thinking I could do this with MailCow and an email relay, but the ones I find online like sendgrid or mailgun only talk about sending email, not receiving it, or need a webhook to forward the received email. 
 Is there a service which could be setup for cheap to receive email for arbitrary mailboxes and arbitrary domains for cheap, which would then be polled by Mailcow to download the email, then delete it from their service?
 My main domain is with a reputable specialized email host, but want a cheap way to setup alternate domains for testing and side projects. I am not looking to send too many emails, but might want to setup some kind of mailing list at some point. I&#x27;m not too concerned about the privacy, or even reliability (within reason), as long as it can guarantee mail availability for at least 24h and email I send through them will not be blocked by gmail or outlook.

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>Background:
 I&#x27;ve recently set up a torrent seedbox/mini home server on my Raspberry Pi 3something. I&#x27;ve got it running qBittorrent-nox, Aria2 (following this and this tutorials,with AriaNg frontend served via Apache), and filebrowser/SFTP/Samba for file access. I had some other services running, but I&#x27;ve stopped them for the moment. I&#x27;ve set Aria2 and qBittorrent to download to /media/pi/Downloads, which is the automatic mount point for my 500GB HDD (NTFS, via FUSE)
 Problem: 
 It doesn&#x27;t download torrents. When I add a torrent in qBittorrent web interface, it&#x27;ll grab the metadata, list tens or hundreds of peers, then I&#x27;ll watch the download speed drop down from KB/s to bytes/s to zero and stop. The same torrent, when added to the Aria2 web interface, will download slowly (though I have seen the first one I tried download at 4 Mbit/s which is very good for my internet). I&#x27;m nervous to stick exclusively with Aria2, however, as, despite downloading the torrents, I can&#x27;t tell whether it seeds them or not. It goes into &quot;seeding&quot; mode, but uploads remain at 0 Kb/s. I need to be able to seed, to use it with a private tracker or two.
 Question:
 Can anyone please help me figure out what&#x27;s wrong with qBittorrent, why it&#x27;s not downloading or seeding torrents, and how to fix it? Is Aria2 actually seeding and I just can&#x27;t see it? Is there any way to tell?
 Many thanks!

                    <span>Hey guys.
 I don&#x27;t really know which sub is right for me since I wasn&#x27;t able to find the cause of the problem yet.
 My setup:
 Home Server running OMV (debian) and Nextcloud 21.0.2, wireguard and a few other services.
 Port forwarding on my ISPs Router (80+443+wireguard port) for my nextcloud instance and wireguard.
 Dyndns and a cname record with my dyndns record at cloudflare, which is the DNS Nameserver for my domain.
 If I decide to use cloudflare as a proxy, everything works as expected with the disadvantage of slower upload speeds from my local network, since everything has to pass &quot;the internet&quot; instead of staying in my local network. But nextcloud is fast, responsible and just works.
 If I on the other hand use &quot;only DNS&quot; without cloudflares proxy, my whole nextcloud instance is barely usable. Every loading of a page takes 10-30s and I sometimes even get a timeout.
 I did not change anything on the configuration of my router, nextcloud or anything. I at most updated my OMV via (apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade) and my ISP is rolling out automatic updates to my router without letting me know or decide about it. 
 What could be a good starting point to locate the cause of this issue? Has someone experienced similar issues? Thanks for your help and sorry for my bad english.

                    <span>What kind of plans do people have in place for disaster recovery? I thinking house burned down and you lost everything. 
 I&#x27;ve got off site backups. But they are encrypted, the encryption keys are in Bitwarden and I&#x27;m not self hosting that. To access Bitwarden I know my master password but I need 2FA, which would be the authenticator app on my phone or my YubiKey, both of which may be lost in a fire. I could also use email but that&#x27;s just shifting the problem because again I&#x27;d need my phone and Bitwarden to get into that. There&#x27;s also the recovery code but where should I keep that so it&#x27;s secure and recoverable? 
 I feel like once I get into Bitwarden the rest is easy, I can access my emails, off site backups, and decryption keys. It might take a while but I think it would be doable assuming I had that recovery code.
 Does anyone ever test their DR plan? Can you eventually access decrypted backups with nothing but a new computer?

                    <span>I have a confusion regarding the working of VPS. In VPSs like from DO,linode,vultr etc. it says that the CPU resource will be shared, but on the pricing page it says I would get 1 vCpu , 1 gb ram &amp; 25gb ssd for 5$. So if I am getting this resources allocated to me by the hypervisor, how can my resources by shared with others and I get into noisy neighbour issues? can anyone clarify the same for me?Do neighbours eat up my CPU power?

                    <span>Hi,
 I have recently started with Wiki.js and in their guide regarding restricted paths there is an information regarding Personal Wiki (path /w). I could not find any information regarding that.
 I am not sure if I understand this correctly. Does it mean users can have personal spaces visible only to them? How to create it?

                    <span>Hi all,
 Trying to figure out how to best host my photos and move away from hosted cloud. Previously I hosted own cloud and switched to nextcloud.
 Currently paused sync untill all my files are nicely structured again and was researching photo management. Photoprism seams a clear winner. My goal would be to sync my photos from laptop and phone to nextcloud and have photoprism recognize all important features.
 A few questions arise when reading through it all: -does photoprism need to make a extra copy of that file? Or will it just add all the info to the &quot;nextcloud&quot; photo. (plenty of storage, so not a major issue) -will the photoprism info also show in the nextcloud environment? -is there a android app to browse through my photos or can I only access it via webinterface -does it change file structure (Pictures/2021/2021-01/filename.jpg)
 Ideally all my photos would be indexed/labeled on all devices so a backwards sync option would be great but not sure that is in the scope of all platforms involved. 
 Is there a clear instruction to run it without docker?

                    <span>Hi all,
 ​
 I followed this tutorial about setting up Docker with Traefik reverse proxy and Portainer as I thought it would suit the set up I would like to achieve. Previously I&#x27;ve run services with Apache virtual hosts. 
 While it&#x27;s taken me a while to get a basic handle on Docker it seems like it might be a quicker easier way to deploy and maintain services - once I get to grips with it. If anyone feels this tutorial doesn&#x27;t create a good foundation to build on please let me know, or point me to a better one.
 What I&#x27;d like is secure access to service1.mydomain.com, service2.mydomain.com etc. For what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;m looking at running Seattle, Plex, Pihole, Tautulli, and perhaps Syncthing and maybe another music-oriented media server (Jellyfin?)
 So, my first point of confusion comes fro…</span>

 Im about to install if for my syncing needs and a colleague in the office is claiming it will distroy my files.
 In any other circumstance, if it was anyone else making that statement, I would probably drop the project but this guy has been wrong on so many other occasions i just need to be sure

                    <span>I have been running Nextcloud off of Diepti on my RPi3B+ for the past 3 years, and the experience has always been excellent so far: packages are well optimised, updates have rarely caused any issue, and the system image is very minimal and decently performant on my low specc&#x27;ed SBC. 
 I have recently happened to look again at Yunohost, and the project seems to have really matured in the past 4 years. I am tempted to switch to their solution, especially to benefit from the plentiful stack of packages available and optimised. 
 My question for you fellow self-hosters is this: has anyone had any experience with Yunohost, and specifically their Nextcloud package, on a RPi? Does it work well enough? Have you had the chance to compare it with Dietpi&#x27;s version?

 One thing I did like about OMV (and other pre-made self-hosting distros) is that all the important pieces are already put into place for you. Are there any self-hosting server checklists so I don&#x27;t forget to do something important?

Holdings can now be based on transactions. There are 3 settings for this: 
 Disabled, which causes transactions not to affect holdings in any way. This is perfect if you&#x27;re too lazy to record your transactions and just want to keep track of your holdings.
 Mixed, where you can edit your holdings, but transactions also affect them and are added/subtracted based on the transaction type (buy/sell).

                    <span>Hello everyone! I am new to the world of self-hosting and server mgmt but I want to learn, so here I am, and I have some questions.
 For some context, I&#x27;ve recently turned an old laptop of mine into a LAMP server and I&#x27;ve gotten it set up with my custom domain and everything. However, I&#x27;ve noticed that I cannot access my custom website or anything from my server unless I&#x27;m on the same network that my server is on. 
 I&#x27;ve set up an OpenVPN server on it, and it works when I&#x27;m on the network, but my connection times out when I try to connect from another network.
 Basically, I&#x27;d like to be able to work on/have full admin access to my server when I&#x27;m at work or something but I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing.
 Thank you in advance for yourself!

                    <span>I have been running at home the Debian based NextcloudPI curl instance on an old Dell laptop for several years. It is a Core 2 Duo T9900 that was repurposed with Debian. Performance with that has been adequate until recently. Since upgrading the unit to Debian 10 and the NextcloudPI curl version it has started to get flakey as heck. The 1 TB drive is more then enough for my needs but I think I need to put this on a new platform. I would like to stay away from Raspberry Pi itself as the hardware as I would like to use a plain SATA (or small ssd) drive.
 Any suggestions

                    <span>Hey everyone, 
 I&#x27;m looking to move to a more lightweight hypervisor/docket host. At the moment I am currently using Windows Server 2019 with HyperV. I&#x27;ve been looking into Proxmox and UnRaid, but I am open to everyone&#x27;s opinions. Right now I have VMs for some game servers, a web server, SQL server, Home Assistant, and a couple of others. What do you guys recommend.

                    <span>Hey guys/girls
 Ive seen a heap of stuff online that this is possible but every avenue that i go down seems to be a failure.
 I have CGNAT at home so unfortunately i cannot port forward. I also have cloudflared (tunnelling service from cloudflare) which i use to route my domain name to my *arr&#x27;s and NPM to. However uploading/downloading non html content through the tunnel is a violation of the ToS of cloudflare so I cannot use that service for UL/DL from/to Nextcloud.
 Enter Zerotier. As it looks from other forums/blogs and websites this looks to be the solution to my CGNAT problem, HOWEVER, I cannot for the life of me figure out the correct steps to set this up. Ive been following these steps:
 1) create my zerotier network and attach my clients to it to assign their own ZT IP addresses a…</span>

 Follow up to: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/o7ham9/selfhosted_imapsmtp_autoresponder/
 Background: I have several mail accounts, that don&#x27;t support proper out-of-office / vacation notices. I was pretty sure, I would find an easy imap&amp;smtp-based solution that could run on my own server. I did find.... nothing.
 Well not quite, I did find a gist on github, that essentally gave me a solid foundation to push this further myself.
 Long story short, here is: praul/autoreply (https://github.com/praul/autoreply)
 You can run this in a docker-container or baremetal on python. It supports multiple mail accounts, date-time ranges and re-reply timeouts.

 It&#x27;s straight docker builds. I usually like to pull from repositories but these docker images sure do make it easy.

Something where I can plug in a tracking number regardless of carrier, and it tracks it through completion? There are alternatives for android like Shop or OneTracker, but those all require creating accounts or permissions to reading emails, both of which i am trying to avoid. Ideally, looking for a self host-able webapp.

                    <span>I&#x27;m hoping to get people&#x27;s experiences from moving from Google password manager to Bitwarden.
 I currently use Google password manager for pretty much everything as I use Chrome desktop and own a Android phone.
 On my Google account I have setup 2FA and account activity, however, I have a concern that all the security of my accounts purely rely on no one getting access to my Google account. 
 Would using Bitwarden really elevate that? And is it worth the risk moving it from a reliable cloud service to a self hosted system?

The app appears to be obsessed with having the db username has &#x27;homestead&#x27;. I have no idea why, I&#x27;ve asked on the &#x27;Dockerholics&#x27; group on Facebook and nobody seems to know.
 However, I&#x27;ve seen that someone of you have managed to install it? Could you shine some light on it?
 This is my YAML for the stack, the only thing I&#x27;ve changed is the app secret. I&#x27;ve tried changing the MySQL credentials to various things but the log still outputs this:
 &quot;MySQL Connection Error: (1045) Access denied for user &#x27;homestead&#x27;@&#x27;172.24.0.3&#x27; (using password: YES)&quot;

                    <span>Hi, i&#x27;m looking for money management that is self hosted, and preferably that can read automatically if possible bank accounts and tie into them somehow. 
 I&#x27;ve found a few older posts and look at some software but they appear to be very much geared toward businesses. I also looked at Firefly but it seems to be very manual on the imports. If there isn&#x27;t really anything that can do automatic imports and I have to go manual route that&#x27;s fine, just not sure if there is anything better then firefly. 
 Thanks!!

                    <span>Hello Everyone,
 for a long Time I searched for a self hosted solution for my Song collection. I was with none of the options I tried really happy. So I decided to develop my own one.
 Hypnos - The selfhosted audio cloud
 Hypnos reads your Songs from a local folder. It uses the Metadata in the files and can use the cover art in the same folder as the Songs/Album. It is 100% free (GPL3) software. Including the javascript(LibreJS compatible). It consists of a back-end service written in rust called Soil and a Typescript front-end called Solanum.
 Your songs will transparently be transcoded to a format that your Browser will understand if required.
 While Hypnos is still very primitive in many areas (no playlist, no user management, etc..) the core feature browsing an playing your Music works.
 I&#x27;m posting this here in case some of you find Hypnos interesting/useful.

                    <span>Hi all,
 Last week I released auto-docker-dash a simple dashboard to show you the status of your docker containers.
 After a massive overhaul of the application, this week we&#x27;ve rebranded and it&#x27;s now known as Plugsy.
 ​
 https://reddit.com/link/o8w7h5/video/eavyy8orys771/player
 New features
 Connectors
 Plugsy now supports multiple connectors that can gather status&#x27; independently. This will allow us to build many more connector types in the future such as Kubernetes, Traefik, Caddy etc. I&#x27;d love to get some feedback on which would be useful to the self-hosted community.
 Connectors that are currently supported:
 Docker
 This is the original, but with the new file configuration, you can now add multiple docker instances/sockets to gather statuses from different locations
 Website
 This is a simple connector that will perform a simple status code check for the given URL, it can also check for a specific regex in the response.
 Raw
 For those links that you just want on your dashboard, you can now include them directly in config.
 Agent Mode
 Plugsy now supports agent mode, allowing you to push changes from 1 Plugsy container to another.
 This is useful should you have multiple docker/connected environments that you&#x27;d like to monitor from a single dashboard.

                    <span>Hey All,
 After a long hiatus of matrix after being a very early adopter I have dived back in.
 Lets just say playbook was a little bit perplexing until I worked out what I was doing.
 Its setup quite nice and have multiple bridges running, which has really allowed me to get rid of Facebook messenger and other spyware off my phone. (sadly it is well used among friends)
 What I cant seem to understand at present, is how often should I be pulling in the new git playbook and essentially running an update?
 Is it mature enough that I can just insert this into an update script and run at leisure? Or do I need to keep an eye on the changelog for monumental breaking things? Can I just set up a watch for the playbook changelog file in git and update only when that is listed as changed, etc.
 What are you doing to keep it updated?

                    <span>Hey all, a while back I announced an API-driven inventory system for Makers.
 It got quite a lot of interest so I&#x27;ve continued to develop it and it now has Octopart support in the latest version.
 Full details can be found on the Github page, and you can either install it as a standard Django app in a virtual environment or use one of the containers (I build for most architectures, happy to add more if there&#x27;s one you really need!)
 It&#x27;s released under the MIT license, so all issues/suggestions/pull requests are welcome!

                    <span>So as a replacement for Google analytics, I played around with Plausible.io (they have a 30 day trial period) and it was a great experience. Just a few days was enough to convince me to self host it. The best part was that their official docker-compose.yml requires little tweaks to make it production ready.
 ​
 If anyone is looking for an open source self hosted analytics, I strongly recommend plausible.
 I have made a blog post on making it production ready (including nginx reverse proxy and TLS certs using let&#x27;s encrypt)

                    <span>Seafile is a software that I have really big love/hate relationship. On one hand, it is amazing when it works (and there is no good alternative), but on the other hand, it has many little papercuts that I&#x27;m constantly dealing with:
  
It&#x27;s not really open source in the full sense. More like only &quot;we publish the source&quot;. They do not interact with the community and Github issues are either ignored or replied with a single sentence and then ignored.
 Their Docker image is terrible. It runs as root, and even worse, it is chained to their own MariaDB configuration (it requires me to give it root password of my MariaDB)
 Files are stored in their proprietary format. I understand that this is necessary for deduplication and file history to work, but the tools to deal with that format are a hassle…</span>

                    <span>Hi Self-Hosters, 
 I was wondering if anyone is able to recommend a good self-hosted financial management system. Ideally what I&#x27;m looking for is:
  
Handle multiple Income accounts
 Track multiple savings goals across different bank accounts
 Handle redraw mortgage accounts
 Have a web UI for managing across the local network
  
I&#x27;m not really fussed about importing transactions directly from my bank, I can enter that manually (and am just about paranoid enough to not trust any service). Currently, I&#x27;m using a google spreadsheet to tell me how much I need to add to each account on a fortnightly basis and to record expenditure against those accounts. I don&#x27;t need to generate invoices.
 Preferring a self-hosted system rather than something I login to over the internet for privacy reasons, and would like something that I can put in a container or a VM so that its accessible on the home network for my wife to be able to access.
 Something simple to use would be a bonus (to keep the wife happy). 
 Also I&#x27;m not an accountant, so if I haven&#x27;t explained myself very well please let me know. 
 Thanks everyone!

The only candidate I found was MediaPortal with aMPdroid, does anyone have experience with that setup, and does it truly store videos on the device?
 Otherwise I have found services such as Plex and Emby, but I would like someone to chip in that those services definitely provide offline playback on their android clients before I buy anything.
 Thanks in advance.

I started a new container or VMs depending from what I needed. Now I ended up with something like 30 ct and 3-4 VMs that I keep regularly updated but I’m wondering about how do I detect if one of these container get breached? Are there anything that can scan these container to search for potential unwanted software?

                    <span>Hello, I want to ask you how secure the following Plex setup is, in regard of anyone possibly seeing what movies are streamed.
 I want to share Plex with my friends - the easy way. Since I&#x27;m behind a double Nat I can&#x27;t forward any ports. My setup is:
 My Plex server is a local unraid NAS. Tailscale is installed in a docker. 
 Tailscale is also installed on a public facing VPS. This VPS is running nginx Proxy Manager, making Plex avaible at a public domain, secured with SSL.
 My question is: Is it possible to sniff (see what type of contend is streamed)? Every connection is encrypted, but does that mean that it is impossible to know what is streamed? (I&#x27;m a noob when it comes to that, sorry). I just don&#x27;t want to get post from authorities or layers demanding huge amounts of money because of my media server.
 Thank you for reading this, sorry for my bad English :)

                    <span>Pterodactyl Panel is a wrapper around docker which is intended to help create and manage game servers.
 I have a VPS server that I&#x27;ve been using for the past 3 years and I host a few light-weight applications on there. Recently, a group of friends and I decided we want to play Valheim and I thought it&#x27;d be a great idea to host a dedicated server on the VPS using pterodactyl panel.
 Now, I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m an expert at this. I&#x27;m a software developer by trade, but in setting up various things on my VPS I&#x27;ve learned a thing or two over the years.
 But Pterodactyl Panel has defeated me. It is written in PHP. I followed both official documentation and community guides. I asked countless questions on their discord. I am faced by problem after problem, some of which I can&#x27;t find any help with at all. It&#x27;s a nightmare. The only solution I see is to either hire a sysadmin to do this for me, or to look for alternatives.
 Anyway, sorry about the rant. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 I&#x27;ve also considered just dumping pterodactyl entirely and just building my own docker images with the servers I need. Would that be a better idea?

 The idea is to record instances where delivery driver leaves slip without attempting to deliver customer&#x27;s package, fakes signatures, etc.

                    <span>Hey everyone,
 for some time already I&#x27;ve been working on setting up my all-in-one self-hosted home server that one day should server as my go-to for many things ranging from development to NAS. I&#x27;m trying to manage as much as possible from a single repository with Ansible. At the moment I&#x27;m at the current state:
  
Ubuntu Server
 K3s Kubernetes cluster single node
 ZFS Pool with a bunch of HDDs
 SSDs
 bunch of other smaller things
  
So far I have not a single utility running that requires any persistent storage. This obviously has to change. And with that I also have to think about redundancy, backups, restoring, and so on. Doing all this on a plain filesystem would be nothing new to me.
 A few random questions:
  
Should I handle backup and snapshots of stuff running in K8s also in K8s? Or do everything on the host OS?
 hostPath volumes? local persistent volumes? longhorn? velero?
  
Would be great if you could share your take on this topic.

                    <span>Looking for selfhosted egress gateway that logs all request / response from all devices.
 Consider it like what pi-hole is for DNS queries, same thing for port 80 and 443 , so that all requests and responses can be logged and analysed in a cool dashboard.
 Custom solution that I know is : 
  
Add nginx logging in a linux box, pass all router traffic to it
 setup EKS , filebeat / logstash for parsing these logs, Elastic search as a datastore and Kibana for beautiful graphs and analysis.
  
​
 But will like to have a plug and play and a beautiful pi-hole like project if such a thing exists.
 For reference something like this software does also:

 I am using onedrive storage + android app to manage automatic backup of photos from my phone and cameras. 
 I am looking for a solution that will allow a unidirectional &quot;backup&quot; of this data from onedrive to my server I.e. create a local copy every x days. As far as I know onedrive doesn&#x27;t have native folder sync with ubuntu.
 I am wanting to do it this way (rather than phone-&gt;server-&gt;cloud) as I can&#x27;t trust 99.9% uptime of my own hardware.
 At the same time I want to package up backups of my docker configs/data and send that to onedrive.
 Can this be done easily with syncthing or rsync?

                    <span>Hello folks, your help will be much appreciated, a client of mine asked me if there&#x27;s any way he can make his service more speedy and up to modern days. 
 Current workflow:
 He does dental prosthesis, so, one dentist sends him a piece to work with an attached paper order with the name of the patient and what&#x27;s needed to be done. So he inputs patient name/type of job/date to be delivered into google calendar and that&#x27;s pretty much it. This might happen a few times with the same piece of work. Every other detail is manually typed in some excel that its only accessible locally. 
 Intended workflow:
 Input patient name/type of job/date to be delivered with a tracking number so any dentist can view in which state the job is, possibly with a QR code that could be printed in the labels for each dentist to keep track of how many jobs are done monthly with each one.
 Of course more features can be applied, I was thinking this more as a logistics kind of software rather than a medical one.

 As with most, we have amassed a large, and growing, collection of images of family and friends, including videos that I would like to host in a local self hosted gallery
 Can someone please recommend a elegant gallery app that is easy for none technical to use for photo management

 I am looking for a cheap dedicated server. Obviously very low end. So far the best price seems to be on kimsufi.com. I wonder whether I missed something even better. 
 I am not bound to any specific architecture (ie: ARM would work).

I&#x27;ve looked at: https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted/blob/master/README.md#photo-and-video-galleries and I&#x27;m not sure any of those provide a feature where you can access a consistent URL and a random image is returned. 
 Reason is I would like more control over what images are displayed, and reduce the latency associated with accessing a remote API.

                    <span>Hi, I need your help with debugging this problem.
 I have just set SMTP server on my Calibre-Web instance (docker image from linuxserver.io) due to instruction from this link. After clicking on &quot;save&quot; button, a green comment appeared saying that settings are saved. After clicking on &quot;Save and sent Test email&quot; red comment appeared saying: &quot;Please configure your email address first...&quot; This is confusing, because settings were saved successfully and look like this.
 When I try to send any ebook to kindle (this email address was white listed in amazon settings), a green comment appears saying, that task was successfully enqueued. Tasks section tells that task was failed.
 logs look like this:
 [2021-06-25 18:58:54,857] ERROR {cps.tasks.mail:148} Connection unexpectedly closed [2021-06-25 19:03:15,873] ERROR {cps.tasks.mail:148} Connection unexpectedly closed 
 I&#x27;ve no idea what needs to be checked and what is broken. Everything else works just fine for this server.

Ive tried multiple different way to get ohmyform working but have been completely unsucessful and wanted to reach out and see what reddit could bring. If anyone knows of any solution preferably free it would be of great help. I need to be able to create different forms and be able to allow certain people to view the responses.

                    <span>Hi, Kind of new to the sub, but not to hosting. Wondering what the consensus is for the members here, are you hosting at home or on a vps/dedicated server?
 I&#x27;ve got a mix myself, but I&#x27;m looking to replace google photos right now and wondering if I should buy a new server for home to add more space or get another vps?

                    <span>I started making ChoreRewards a few weeks ago, which is essentially a reward system build for children. If the child does a chore, they get points which they can then use to &quot;purchase&quot; items. 
 It&#x27;s purpose is to give children the sense of accomplishment, as they will be able to mark their chores as &quot;done&quot; and to teach the value of money; should I purchase X now, or save up my &quot;points&quot; and purchase Y? 
 Anyway, V0.1 of the backend is almost ready and I thought I&#x27;d see if there are any frontend devs who want to help me build it out? 
 I can do frontend, by which I mean I can muddle around and make something functional; but I don&#x27;t have a UX bone in my body.
 Happy to discuss more about the project, answer questions, or tell me you&#x27;re interested in the project itself if you think it might be something you can use when it&#x27;s ready!

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure if this has been discussed recently, but I am looking for an iCloud alternative for my Apple devices. I know there are lots of services that can replace some individually (like using NextCloud), but I am looking for what the best options are. One thing that I am really wanting is something similar to iMazing which looks like an amazing product but just a little outside my use case (and if something else will do it for free, all the better).
 What I like about iMazing is that I can backup and manage all of my data (messages, photos, apps, the works) from a remote location with a UI that is very similar to iTunes. I&#x27;m trying to set up a family backup of photos and iPhones for my parents and siblings and so having that ease of use is key. The downside of iMazing is that the unlimited plan only lets me have 2 computers with keys so only myself and one other household can manage their devices or I can get lifetime keys for 10 devices but I need more future proofing because we will have more iPhones in the family inevitably. 
 What is your setup for iOS backup and management for your home setups and specifically what is your ideal photo backup setup that you use for those people who aren&#x27;t tech savvy (i.e parents/siblings).

                    <span>Hello,
 I am running a small hypervisor with about 50 vm&#x27;s for me and some friends.
 One of them pointed me at sonatype&#x27;s repomanager that would let me cache registries like apt, yum, dnf, npm, docker etc. 
 This would speed up lots of things in our environment. However it seem like there is no CE of this product and it costs a yearly subscription fee.
 Is there a simular product like repomanager I could use?
 Any reccomendations welcome :)
 Cheers,
 Ori

 I can join these games locally, but joining from outside the network is not possible.

 I would like to avoid plex, kodi, jellyfin etc. because I dont really need all their features. I Just want a way to pick up my smarphone and stream the medias to my crhomecast. The simplier the better. 
 What&#x27;s about an android filemager accessing via ssh my pi and stream from vlc?

                    <span>I&#x27;m building some servers using proxmox which will include Pi-Hole, Jellyfin (which should be accessible from outside the network), cloud storage, a wiki... To access Jellyfin from the outside I was planning on using reverse proxy on the same container I was holding Jellyfin, but I&#x27;m thinking of having a server do all the proxy of the whole network (so I can avoid having to write down the ports every time I have to enter the interface of something).
 But I have no idea how to do that. First I&#x27;m doubting whether I should use Nginx, Apache, Caddy (since I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s fairly easy to setup) or something like Traefik, and once chosen that how I&#x27;d have to make it so everything goes through the proxy to then be redirected.
 Any tips or suggestions?

 I have an Odroid-XU4 with Ubuntu 18.04.5. I am currently using it as self-hosted cloud with Nextcloud. Now I would like to implement a wiki. I have seen DokuWiki, Wiki.js, and BookStack. However, I can&#x27;t find any tutorial for installing any of them on a RPI/Odroid. 
 Which self-hosted wiki might be better suited for an Odroid-XU4? Do you know any resource for helping me with the installation?
 Thanks in advanced!

                    <span>Hi guys, 
 some time Last night I received a dmarc report from mail.ru. According to the report, three IP addresses from Laos and Kenya tried to send e-mails impersonating my domain name, as SPF and DKIM all failed.
 A friend of mine, who also self hosts his email did also receive a dmarc report for his domain, also from mail.ru.
 I guess someones currently trying to mass-impersonate?
 Are there any of you guys, that also received such a report? 
 As far as I know there is not much I can do prevent them from pulling this kind of shit, is it?
 Does stuff like this happen often? I&#x27;ve only been selfhosting my email for about a year now and I&#x27;ve never seen a dmarc report that I didn&#x27;t trigger myself...
 The IP addresses are: 
  
115.84.76.144
 41.90.244.243
 154.79.254.144
 45.164.140.147

                    <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;m looking for a selfhosted autoresponder for multiple mail accounts from different providers. 
 Not all of them are offering decent autoresponder settings on the server side.
 The autoresponder would have to check for new emails over imap and then send autoresponds over smtp.
 Basically just like an email client with filters, but running on a 24-7 server - and not interfering with the actual email clients.
 Does anyone know a good solution?
 Thanks in advance
 edit: my google searches return a lot of newsletter tools. I&#x27;m not looking for anything newsletter related. Just a simple &quot;I&#x27;m on vacation&quot; Message on incoming email.
 in Germany we use the term autoresponder for it. This maybe wrong. I&#x27;m looking for a tool that sends &quot;out of office&quot; notices

                    <span>I dream of having some sort of home page with metrics about personal goals, calendar events, and other services. Because I&#x27;d like it to be open-source, I looked into Nextcloud, which is awesome but it lacks goal-tracking and a wiki, which I&#x27;d really like to have. I have also looked into &quot;Personal Management System&quot;, which looks really interesting, but it lacks the community behind Nextcloud in order to earn my trust to use it in the long run. Ideally it would be awesome to be able to visualize all aspects of life, while retrieving this data from the top services of each category. Imagine a home page with a Kanboard from WeKan, storage from Nextcloud, goal tracking (maybe Nomie?), some notes in form of a wiki...
 ​
 What sort of set up would you recommend that satisfies this, or at least gets close to it? Sorry if I make some mistakes, English is not my first language.
 ​
 ** Maybe someone may suggest that I should contribute to some of these projects in order to create the features I wish to see. I would love to, however at this moment in time I lack the necessary skills.
 ** EDIT **
 Let me clarify for those who didn&#x27;t get the gist of what I&#x27;m trying to communicate: I&#x27;m looking for something analogous to what Android/iOS is to Widgets. 
 You have a main screen that show information and functionalities from the system or third party services/apps that are easily visualized and/or manipulated. So far I found Nextcloud+nextcloud apps to satisfy most of these needs, but I still miss some resources as mentioned above. Thank you!

                    <span>I probably did this to myself but I cannot figure this out and once again my Google fu is coming up short. 
 I have the following:
 A home pc for photo editing, video editing, day to day work/internet etc A gaming pc that’s purely for gaming A work windows laptop A MacBook
 Also my server “farm” consists of 3 Ubuntu servers. 
 Last night I noticed my internet was lagging and downloading large amounts of data and I couldn’t figure out why. Usually it’s sonarr or radarr or sometimes it’s someone downloading tv shows off of Plex. 
 When I ruled out that none of that was happening I installed wire shark and another program to see if I could see what was happening. I couldn’t. 
 So just for giggles I rebooted every server. And that didn’t help so figured it was one of my other devices. I shut t…</span>

                    <span>Posting here at the recommendation on another subreddit. 
 I have about 1500 movie/TV Series library all on DVD&#x27;s/BD. I took the time to rip the entire library. I took my time and it took me about 3 years to rip and convert it. Unfortunately a good 2/3 of the files were corrupted because of a bad RAID set up I was using at the time. I have since upgraded to a 4K TV and set up the latest Apple TV and I wanted to rebuild my library. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a better way to do this. Not only is ripping/transcoding time consuming, but now that I finally own a 4K HDR TV, there&#x27;s no pointing re-ripping my DVD collection. I have hard copies, so I think licensing isn&#x27;t an issue. I also have a spreadsheet with name of every movie I own with IMDB link. Is there a better way to do this? Torrent? How would I automate this on my TrueNAS and just have it slowly rebuild it overtime...mostly unattended of course. Is this possible?

                    <span>Hey there,
 I was thinking to host a few projects using a cellphone internet data plan as a failover when my actual internet is out.
 Can anyone point me in the right direction as to a good device to route a cellphone internet plan, and basically make a hotspot for home usage?
 I think I looked this up before, and the decent one I think is like $500, but I can&#x27;t remember the dang name of the device.
 Also, are there even cellphone providers that allow this?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi All,
 ​
 I run docker on my synology nas along with a few containers, including the above. Within the containers i sometimes have a hard time accessing lan devices. For instance, if i am using node red and i put a tp link kasa node, it finds nothing. If i were to run node red on my raspberry pi and apply the same node it finds all my lan tp link smart plugs. Besides adding the containers to a macvlan on the synology nas, is there any other way to get around this issue? I created a macvlan, but now the issue is whenever i connect to my home vpn (it runs on the same nas as docker) i can not access those ips on the macvlan.
 ​
 Thank you.

                    <span>Hi there!
 Over the past week or two I have been working on a web application that allows you to explore your DJI drone footage on a map! I am finally confident enough to tell you about it, so that those interested can test it and try it for themselves. 
 In order for it to work the footage has to have been shot with the subtitle telemetry settings enabled.
 https://github.com/vimodev/dronemap
 https://hub.docker.com/r/vimodev/dronemap
 Features
  
Footage directory scanning
 Automatic parsing and analysis of DJI footage
 Exploration of extracted datapoints on a map
 Filtering map markers based on footage attributes
 Watching raw footage from which data points originated
  
Screenshots
 Example usage.
 Satellite view.
 OpenStreetMap view.
 Inspecting a datapoint.
 ​
 Viewing datapoint origin in original footage.
 Remarks
  
The styling is lackluster due to my personal disregard for design. It can of course be improved in due time.
 It has been developed with and tested for DJI Mini 2 footage only. I have no other footage available to me. I am running with the assumption that other DJI footage is in the same format with regards to the subtitled data points DJI optionally includes.
 If you encounter any issues please submit them on github.

                    <span>I am just wondering about something, if we have an EC2 instance with Public IP, IP Tables enabled and for example I want to expose a single service on one port, accessible only from my VPN with Static IP, will it be safe if I only open ONE port only for the PublicIP of the VPN machine?
 In summary I am asking if the cloud firewall (security list) will be enough to protect my machine with Public IP...

                    <span>Hi there! I&#x27;m really new into this but I&#x27;m looking for solutions to self-host videos that users can watch. The only requirement is that users have to be logged in to view them and some sort of comment system should be available. Is there anything out there? Preferably a free solution (not counting the costs for hosting it).

                    <span>Hi everyone, first time posting to this sub. I&#x27;ve spent the last week scouring the interwebs and I haven&#x27;t found anyone talking about what I&#x27;m trying to do. Any help would be very greatly appreciated. 
 I&#x27;m trying to connect two remote locations together. Both locations have a dynamic IP address. Everything I&#x27;ve seen so far has suggested using a Dynamic DNS service or buying a domain name and using a free Dynamic DNS. Those are great ideas but I know there&#x27;s got to be a way to do this for free. If it can&#x27;t be done, then it can&#x27;t be done, but purely on principle I feel like it&#x27;s total bullshit that there&#x27;s no free alternatives that don&#x27;t rely on the whim of an ISP or third party services. 
 This is what I was thinking, neither IP changes all that frequently, maybe once every month or 2. Additionally, it seems very unlikely that both IP&#x27;s would change at exactly the same time. Would it be possible to run an automatic process at both locations that would constantly update their IP&#x27;s to one another? 
 So we have location A and location B that constantly talk to each other and update the IP address. At location A, the IP address changes. Now, location B doest know the new IP address of location A. Because the two IP&#x27;s didn&#x27;t change at the same time, location A still knows the IP address of location B and subsequently can send the updated IP address. 
 Anyone know if anything like this exists or have any ideas for free alternatives? 
 On a side note, I have an old TPlink Archer A9 that I&#x27;m not using, it has a free Built-in ddns with tp-link. I switched over to an edge router. Is there anyway I could put the A9 in a DMZ on the network and have it only for updating the ddns? Could I switch to IPV6?
 Honestly, any free and automated ideas would be perfect. Would love to hear what you guys and gals think!
 Thanks again

                    <span>I&#x27;m hosting a private instance of ArchiveBox, a great way to safe and preserve internet articles offline. It is however increasingly unusable when websites are behind a cookie-wall.
 Is there a similar self-hosted private offline webpage archiving solution that is specifically designed to accept all cookies (and preferably block ads from being archived as well)? For example, The Internet Archive (archive.org) does this somewhat better.

 I recently purchased https://www.alltheviruses.com and am looking to provide some &quot;lightly used&quot; service that would beneficial to the community. 
 I could host a url shortener, but that&#x27;s not a very short url..
 I could run a Pilk instance https://pilk.root.gg/#/ but I think that could be misused.
 I am willing to simply host a site that explains the differences between malware and viruses. 
 Point is I own it for a year, and wouldn&#x27;t mind giving back to the community at large. What services do you wish you had? What level of service would you be willing to trust such a outlandish url? How many of you thought it was just as funny as I?

                    <span>Kasm Workspaces delivers interactive access to GUI applications and desktop environments running in docker containers. The containers are streamed directly to the browser. The platform is similar to Citrix and VMware Horizon, but entirely container based. 
 ​
 ​
 Kasm Workspaces
 ​
 The quickest way to see what we are about is to launch a demo session using any of the following links. No install - No sign-up - just solve a captcha. 
  
Ubuntu Bionic Desktop
 Google Chrome
 Visual Studio Code
  
(Note: Traffic filtering and timeout features are enabled to limit abuse)
 While Workspaces is a commercial product, we have roots in /r/selfhosted and /r/homelab style communities so it’s always been a priority to offer a free, self-hosted, easy-to-install, feature rich community edition. 
 ​
 The core components of the platform are also open source.
  
KasmVNC in the streaming tech used to deliver interactive access to the containers via the browser. (https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC)
 All of our application and desktop images are open source as well. (https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-images) - (https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-core-images)
  
​
 Folks commonly use Workspaces for….
  
Secure and private internet access leveraging disposable browser containers.
 Remote access solution for VDI (ahem CDI) / Development / Bastion Hosts / Training environments
 Integrate into existing platforms/environments by leveraging our API
 Slaying demons in hell
  
​
 If you&#x27;d like to run Workspaces yourself, you can Download and Install the software on popular Linux distros. I hope this provides something of value to this community and I appreciate any feedback. 
 Thanks to the mods for allowing me to post.

                    <span>I recently heard about Shodan Monitor, a service that monitors open ports on given IPs, however I was hoping to see if anyone knew of something similar that could be self hosted. 
 I&#x27;m aware I could have nmap run periodically and diff the changes which would send an alert but I wondered if a tool already existed or as a part of an already existing NMS. It&#x27;d just be nice to have features like history and and nice web interface, like Shodan Monitor has.

I tried putting the synology IP address in there and nothing happened. I literally have no clue what I&#x27;m doing and know nothing about setting up this kind of stuff. I tried looking for other resources but the two or three websites I could find about this just used the same pictures lol. Can somebody hold my hand and walk me through how to set this up? If not, that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ve been trying to figure this out for hours and coming here was my last resort. I&#x27;ll probably just give up on it.

                    <span>I came across this a while ago and just can&#x27;t find it anymore. IIRC it works by adding a folder called .backups or something in the destination folder you&#x27;re syncing to and storing older versions (or deltas?) of the directory there.
 I think it was called &quot;rsync-diff&quot; or &quot;rsync-backup&quot; or something but that doesn&#x27;t bring anything up. Thanks in advance if anyone knows something.
 Edit: aah I just found it! It&#x27;s called rsnapshot

 If I Set Up Guacamole with 2FA behind a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX Proxy Manager), do I still need a VPN server? Why/why not?
 I realize using a VPN would be the most secure way to go about things, but I&#x27;m still pretty new to self-hosting, and I&#x27;m not entirely clear on what security vulnerabilities I&#x27;d be at risk for if I just set things up like this:
 remote client  public internet  https://guacamole.exampledomain.com (Cloudflare proxied domain with Cloudflare-issued SSL certificate)  NGINX Proxy Manager (reverse proxy) on RPI serving HTTPS connections  guacamole server with Google Authenticator/2FA on RPI (docker)  servers behind Guacamole.
 Assuming nothing evil is happening with the SSL certificate on my guacamole subdomain, where is the security risk that makes a VPN necessary? Is the concern packet sniffing while connected to the public internet at a Starbucks (that is, the use case for VPN generally), or is there something specifically insecure about running guacamole this way?

                    <span>Greetings,
 I was wondering if anyone can recommend a self hosted Twitter media downloader, similar to YouTube-dl. I actually tried using it to download Twitter media but it didn’t work. 
 Thanks !

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed

Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

                    <span>Hi Everyone, 
 Im currently working on improving a python notebook guide and I was hoping to get some feedback on what things might not make sense or are not beginner friendly. 
 Some of my main questions are:
  
Should I provide more inline comments or try to have all the explanations in their own box? 
 Is it easier or harder to follow when all the outputs are saved and displayed?
 Should I have the download scripts included or have the user download the images themselves?
  
Thanks for all the help!

                    <span>Hey friends,
 I wanted to learn BASH and in addition learn the Linux operating system usually the best.
 I wanted to create for myself some purpose, for example: Set up a NextCloud server from scratch
 But I set up such a server, I finished successfully, and yet I still feel that my knowledge is low
 Do you have any ideas for home apps and services or server that I could set up?
 I would love advice on all areas and not just a home cloud. I would love all ideas of all kinds, such as home monitoring, information security and more.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 Like the title says, I&#x27;m looking for a self-contained server or combination of code and packages (e.g.: nginx, Ruby, Python, etc) to host a local website with mostly documentation of my homelab.
 It should support online editing with an option for WYSIWYG (if possible), Markdown syntax and redering with Mermaid and/or PlantUML support and backend based on static files (.md and .yaml would be perfect).
 I&#x27;ve checked a number of open-source and free wiki and documentation packages out there that includes most features above, but they all seem to rely on some sort of database to store the data and settings.
 Relying on a database makes me worry about backup procedures and how to migrate the docs to different tool in the future. I&#x27;d rather prefer to just have a bunch of folders with md/png/svg/yaml files 😆 
 At the moment, I&#x27;m considering deploying a local Gitlab instance, it does all I need but the WYSIWYG editing.
 Would you have any suggestions? Likely, I skipped some obvious choices for you (say, e.g., perhaps WordPress does the job!), so please feel free to share any inputs, they&#x27;ll be very appreciated.
 Thanks!

 I am looking for one that is self-hosted to run it on my local server. I&#x27;ve tried to look around, but cannot find anything. Well, actually I found only calibre-web, but I wonder if there are others.

                    <span>Hello all, Ive been reading through the past posts a bit but I am a bit overwhelmed by it so hoping someone can point me in the right direction. I am looking for a very simple solution to hosting/sharing a folder (+/-100GB) on my Mac mini with 3-5 friends. I use my Mac mini as a plex server so it is always running. I have a folder of various audiobooks, books and music that I want them to be able to access on their Mac/PC and download whatever they want whenever they want. Dropbox works nicely but I am not interested in paying for the extra storage and I don&#x27;t need anything stored in the cloud. 
 What suggestion do you have for my best option to look into?

 I also want to do this because when i travel to my public IP or get a domain name incorrect it defaults to the nginx landing page.. I would rather get a did not connect page so it doesnt clue people in that there are services running. Is there any way to do this?

                    <span>Hey guys, 
 I wrote a guide on setting up a Jolpin Server with Docker, Traefik and SSL. 
 With Joplin Server you have the possibility to host your notes yourself. There are a lot of desktop apps for almost every system and mobile apps for iOS and Android. 
 With optional end-to-end encryption, you also have one of the most secure note servers around.

 Let me know what you think of Joplin Server. I kicked out Nextcloud Notes and have recently started using only Jolpin and so far I&#x27;m very happy.

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking for something to help organize shopping lists.
 Previously my wife &amp; I used Out of Mil, which was nice. But not self-hosted. It did however, work. Now that they&#x27;ve been brought out and will no longer work for non US based users, we can no longer use it.
 Grocy looked like it may fit the bill, but it&#x27;s a bit too complete. I need the all important spousal-approval factor. Adding a new item in a shopping list required setting the item up first, we just need something to show a checklist really.
 So, TL;DR. I&#x27;m looking for something, self hosted that&#x27;ll allow us to create a list, with the ability to check items off as they&#x27;re picked up. The list needs to be available to multiple users. Ideally needs a companion Android app, but PWA is perfectly fine too.
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>Hi,
 I have been searching for a solution to my music &#x27;needs&#x27;. Different solutions exist, but I seem to be unable to find a solution that just &#x27;does it all&#x27;. Basically I&#x27;m looking for a selfhosted Spotify-like solution without the fancy &#x27;I think you will like this music&#x27;-suggestions. :)
 I have a self built NAS with all my music on it, a receiver in my living room (Yamaha R-N303D, DLNA/Airplay capable), a RPi with speakers connected to it in my bathroom (running piCorePlayer at the moment), and a bunch of smartphones, tablets etc.
 I am looking for a selfhosted solution that enables me to:
  
maintain my music collection (e.g. scan music into a database, playlist manipulation, etc) using a nice web user interface
 listen to the music using a web browser (using the same nice web user interface), so that I can access my music remotely
 control what is playing on the home appliances in my home (receiver and RPi)
 sync subsets of my music files (certain playlists) to my tablets, smartphones, etc. so that I can listen to it while I&#x27;m offline (car, commute on public transportation, etc.)
  
The solutions that I found so far are either good at 1/streaming to a browser, or 2/ streaming to home appliances (for example Airsonic vs. Logitech Media Server). But I&#x27;m looking for a marriage of both.
 Any suggestions/thoughts on how I can achieve this?

                    <span>Hey folks,
 I&#x27;ve just published the blog post update for May. This one is more about quality over quantity but I&#x27;m really excited to get the top item released as it&#x27;s should be quite a game changer. Here&#x27;s the blog post and here&#x27;s a quick run-down:
  
Face recognition and automatic grouping
 Search auto-completion
 Commands for creating additional users and assigning to libraries
 Date-based event tagging
 Ability to download photos from within browser
 Map view state now restored after returning from detail view
 Animated hint to show that there are more filters available
 GitHub sponsors
  
Thanks to everyone involved this month. Please feel free to drop a comment with your feedback or questions.

                    <span>I need an application which can auto download videos from my favourite channels and organise them in folders by the channel name.
 Any application or set of applications which can do this?

                    <span>I recently obtained an older 4 bay NAS from my boss that he said he no longer wanted. I figured, ehh what the heck. It can serve its place somewhere in my network. So, I booted it up at first, being the first time I initially plugged it in, and got a &quot;Booting...&quot; on the LCD. I figured all was well so I moved it to my rack and plugged it in and now its shows &quot;█ █ █ █ █ █ █ █&quot; for some apparent reason. I dont know what happened as there is practically zero documentation pertaining to the issue. I&#x27;ve also tried resetting it but also did not work. 
 I figured maybe one of yall might&#x27;ve experience the same thing if youve ever had a Thecus NAS.

                    <span>Greetings,
 I&#x27;ve been playing with docker a bit on my synology NAS and I think I&#x27;m ready to try something a bit more difficult. I&#x27;d like to set things up so that three small JAMStack-based (Gatsby and Hexo) websites I have could be built and deployed from my NAS instead of github actions.
 However, my knowledge of self-hosted build systems is very old (circa 2008). Does anyone have any suggestions for an environment that is working well for you? Currently the code for the sites is hosted on github and deployed to (very) inexpensive hosting via FTP, although that&#x27;s subject to change as I bring more stuff back to the home network.

                    <span>Hello there !
 First serious post here, as I&#x27;m kind of new to the community. Also, English&#x27;s not my first language, so please, bear with me.
 I&#x27;m trying my ass off to /r/degoogle my life, and selfhosting must be part of this process as anyway, I need some cloud storage for my work / hobbies.
 So I got myself a RaspberryPi 4B 4Go and started everything from scratch. It took me like 2 months and several sleepless nights to manage to get a proper Nextcloud instance running, even though I can&#x27;t get Collabora to work. So I decided to try and install CryptPad.
 But first, a word about my setup and my &quot;knowledge&quot;.
 My Raspberry runs RaspberryPi OS 64bits (beta), on top off which I installed OMV. Through OMV, I installed Docker and Portainer.
 The only way I could understand how to deploy a contai…</span>

 I found mkcert, installed it on the same ubuntu machine and manually added the certs to the docker container. All works for me. I&#x27;m just wondering if there are any security concerns with this solution? If so, what are they and how would you proceed instead?

 And on that same topic, are there any tools you would recommend that can be Self-Hosted? What would be cool is Self-Hosted Versions of Prezi, Canva, Pixlr, and PDF2GO, among others.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to setup email notifications for fail2ban using https://linuxconfig.org/configuring-gmail-as-sendmail-email-relay this guide.
 Here&#x27;s the login conf for my email server :
  
host: mail.selfhost.drtech.cc
 port: 465
 TLS with authentication required
  
I modified the blogpost like so to accommodate my settings :
 define(\SMART_HOST&#x27;,&#x60;[[mail.wp.ahmads.cc](https://mail.wp.ahmads.cc)]&#x27;)dnl&#x60;
 define(\RELAY_MAILER_ARGS&#x27;, &#x60;TCP $h 465&#x27;)dnl&#x60;
 define(\ESMTP_MAILER_ARGS&#x27;, &#x60;TCP $h 465&#x27;)dnl&#x60;
 define(\confAUTH_OPTIONS&#x27;, &#x60;A p&#x27;)dnl&#x60;
 TRUST_AUTH_MECH(\EXTERNAL DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN&#x27;)dnl&#x60;
 define(\confAUTH_MECHANISMS&#x27;, &#x60;EXTERNAL GSSAPI DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN&#x27;)dnl&#x60;
 FEATURE(\authinfo&#x27;,&#x60;hash -o /etc/mail/authinfo/wpmail-auth.db&#x27;)dnl&#x60;
 However, no emails are getting sent out ?

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m searching for a way to setup something Like Pritunl (or any other VPN Server) on a local machine, and make it accessible from the outside, so that I can share my Plesk Server and NAS with some friends.
 I don&#x27;t have access to the router. I thought about services Like ngrok, but they are quite expensive for such a task, and I have enough VPS Servers and capacity to host something like that myself. 
 Since I&#x27;m fine with hosting it myself I wanted to ask you if you have any advice how to set it up the best way, or any Tutorial you could link me to.
 Thank you :)

                    <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 i already did a bit of research. My Company is looking for a documentation/wiki software which is self hosted and mostly free. We need advanced permission management, Active Directory support and it should be easy to use and to setup.
 ​
 I installed xwiki and wikijs. Both look kinda easy, but wikijs is the handling for users a bit difficulty in my opinion. XWiki looks like from 1990 but I guess its all dependable on extensions there. Overall it seems also to be way more complicated.
 ​
 Any hints on hidden gems or similiar?

                    <span>Hi there!
 I was wondering if there is any self hosted trading dashboard, to follow ETF, cryptocurrencies, etc.
 So far I didn&#x27;t find anything, maybe I am not using the proper terms though...
 ​
 To be more precise, a simple HTML5 dashboard with an admin panel where we can set some ETF we want to follow, would be enough.

                    <span>Hey I have a simple question,
 I wonder how proxy sellers (luminati, proxy-cheap ...) track user data usage (how many gb they use) without the user having the SSL certificate installed on his computer.
 They cannot know the size of the requests made by the user, am I wrong?

                    <span>I want to setup the netplan for a bridged network adapter in Ubuntu Server 20.04 running as a guest on a Windows 10 Desktop. The network adapter is currently not working as expected, it doesn&#x27;t use an IP adress. I want to use the server as part of the network of the host machine directly connencted to the router. I want to ssh into the server with an Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 also using network bridge where everything works fine.
 I want to use the server as a storage for SnipeIT and it needs to be setup on a server with internet connectivity and a static IP adress. I will also install ApacherServer on it.
 Current netplan setup
 How does the netplan need to be setup? Which parameters do I need to use?

                    <span>Hi there guys, hope you&#x27;re all good! :)
 I&#x27;m hosting multiple services at home, and was wondering what would be the best way to manage the domain names. At the moment, i&#x27;m just creating an A record for every services pointing to the same IP and use NPM to redirect them to the correct port/service. So it looks like jellyfin.domain.com, this.domain.com, than.domain.com... I&#x27;m sure there is an easier way ? Using a wildcard maybe ? And having NPM doing the redirection ?

                    <span>to preface i am a complete noob when it comes to networking and frankly i&#x27;m amazed that I have reached even this point of getting my jellyfin server to function.
 Ok so what i would really like to do is to share my jellyfin server library to friends and family without having them to type in my local ip address apparently that isnt safe and somehow my overseas friend is unable to access even if he enters my local ip address to the search bar.
 what i have now is my jellyfin server and a domain name that i bought from domain.com which seems to already come with the letsencrypt SSL thing is that really the case?
 From what i can tell from researching online there is a whole thing about using Caddy, Xampp, Apache etc which is all very confusing and im unable to make heads or tails about it.
 I would like help to know if there is any resource that clearly shows the steps i need to set up a reverse proxy for the specific use case that i would like to achieve. And even then is reverse proxy even what i need for this case or there is another workaround of redirecting localhost to my domain name?

                    <span>So, I have a little setup issue I’m trying to work through and need some help. I have successfully setup my Rpi4 as a Wireguard server with Pihole also installed. I have created a few clients and all can connect to the pi no problem. Here’s the issue I&#x27;m having trouble with- I have a Synology server I’m trying to setup for external connection ONLY through the PiVPn. I bought a USB-Ethernet adapter and plugged the Syno into it (the Pi) but I cannot connect to it when I do, not even locally. I would like to disable Syno’s quickconnect as it’s a security hole and I want to shut any ports that are not absolutely necessary. How can I utilize the Pi as a VPN gateway to the NAS as a client? (Before anyone asks why I didn&#x27;t just use the Syno as a VPN server- I had the Pi and wanted to make good use of it as well as PiHole) 
 Thanks so much in advance!

                    <span>OK... I self hosted lots of media services, but I have the idea that choice can be a downside. For the older gang here... remember just turning on the TV at 1am when you got home from a night out and discovering an amazing new random film or when you are stuck at home sick watching bad daytime TV because their was no choice?!
 So here is the idea.. I have lots of content (have actually collected lots of bad TV, old commercials, great shows etc) and I would like to simulate TV channels from different places and times (currently have content for channels for &quot;usa 80&#x27;s&quot; &quot;USA early 90&#x27;s&quot; &quot;UK 80&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;soviet block early 70&#x27;s&quot;)
 Wanted to ask you guys if you had ideas about setup... I can set this up, but most options seem like a pain!
 In a perfect world (perhaps asking too much!) - docker container - web interface - feed it a m3u or manage it inside? - able to do multiple streams 
 Even something that piggyback on jellyfin or plex?
 Any ideas?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I still very new to all this but I am learning every day from all of you.
 Is anyone currently running vaultwarden with nginx proxy manager to manage the route to it and the cert?
 Just looking for a way to set it up. I believe if I set NPM up to use http and port 80 I can get a cert and it seems to work. I&#x27;m just wondering if that&#x27;s the most secure way to run it.
 Previously I was running it using the docker compose documentation on vaultwarden wiki with Caddy for cert management almost exactly the way the documentation suggests. But I wanted to use NPM to point to some other VMs so I had to forward firewall ports 80 and 443 to that VM.
 Thanks for any help you can provide. Sorry if any of my terminology is incorrect!

                    <span>I am currently looking to upgrade from my tiny Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB Plex server so that I can scale to more powerful virtual servers and to switch over my costly cloud VPS services since seeing people on YouTube use VMWARE’s ESXI so that the server acts just like a virtual machine (NetworkChuck). 
 Mostly what I plan on running, a few servers, some on and off: 
  
Minecraft
 Terraria
 Wordpress
 Valheim (maybe… it gets a little demanding after a while)
 Vaultwarden
 Few other small things
  
I don’t want to spend too much (less than 600) but I am willing to spend a little more money if it would make a difference.
 Features I’m looking for:
  
Easily removable drives
 Ethernet (of course)
 64GB ram if possible
 An above average CPU
 Maybe put a little graphics card when I want so I can run plex arcade
  
This looks good to me
 I am looking for a server to slowly remove all the VPSs that I constantly pay for and want to go full self host since I am able to manage them on my own. I just can’t find the right specs and value, if anyone has a few in mind that would help.
 I am educated with the command line but not with ESXI or home/virtual server management. Yes I am looking to run multiple different operating systems and I prefer Ubuntu server.

                    <span>Hi there,
 I have been playing around with self hosting this year. I want to take it a step further. I want to host Proxmox. I cannot build a server at home, I need to do it in the Cloud.
 I&#x27;m thinking about renting a dedicated server at Hetzner. I can rent it Germany for 47 euros a month, but in Finland it costs 41 euros a month. 
 I think it is a lot of money but I think I&#x27;m able to do it and I really like all the things I can do if I have a dedicated server. 
 ​
 Now, I have used iperf to test the internet connection. When my PC is the client I get about 10Mbit per second (my upload speed at home) with both servers in Germany and Finland. If my PC is the server, and I try iperf on a server in Germany as client I get 75Mbit per second (my download speed at home). If I try the server in Finland as client I get about 60Mbit per second, about 20% less when trying from Germany.
 The ping is 20ms to Germany but 40ms to Finland.
 ​
 I want to host things like, OpenVPN, PiHole, Bitwarden and much more on dedicated server. Basically I want to connect to the VPN server all the time, when I am at home or traveling or work. 
 Should I go with more expensive but closer internet connection or less expensive but a bit slower internet connection?
 I would like to go with the cheapest. Since I&#x27;m the only user on the dedicated server anyway. Does it matter so much I get a little bit lower bandwidth and a little bit higher ping???

                    <span>Hi all,
 i would like to switch from my current postfix/dovecot/rspamd installation to mailcow. the domain should stay the same, maybe the ip address can stay the same too. What is the best option to migrate as smoothly as possible? I have 4 active email accounts on the server, all are in a maildir format and are stored under home of the respective user (eg. home/user/Maildir)
 I would keep the downtime as low as possible and migrate all mails to Mailcow.
 There&#x27;s some kind of guide, but I&#x27;m unsure if it &#x27;really&#x27; works:

                    <span>Hi everyone!
 With the recent google photos change I&#x27;ve decided that it might be a good time to upgrade my plex server in order to also host a service like Photoprism. The issue is that I&#x27;m currently running my plex server on an Alienware X51-R2, which is still running really well, but doesn&#x27;t have room in the case/motherboard to add more drives and it&#x27;s likely an absolute pain to transfer the system to a new case and upgrade to a new motherboard. 
 So the question I have for you guys is: what would you recommend I do? Should I buy a raid enclosure, external drives, or some other way to extend my storage on my Alienware X51-R2 or should I try to instead buy something like a Synology Nas?
 Some quick system details:
  
i5-3330
 8 GB of Ram
 GeForce GT 640
 1 TB hard drive

                    <span>Hello, hope you&#x27;re doing well. I have this problem where I try to get Caddy reverse proxy to work. At port 9000 I have a dockerized MinIO instance running that I want to point to my domain name via an A+Dynamic Record, which has a value of 127.0.0.1.
 My domain is on NameCheap, so I downloaded and installed their DDNS Client v2 and configured everything.
 When trying to access the proxied port(80), it just won&#x27;t load. Like literally, my Firefox says that there&#x27;s a problem with loading the page.
 I have tried messing around with my firewall but still nothing. I have opened a thread on Caddy&#x27;s official forum. Sadly no progress yet.
 Here&#x27;s the link: https://caddy.community/t/novice-trying-to-setup-reverse-proxy-from-on-node-js-app-from-port-3001-to-80-without-ssl/12815/6
 The only difference is that there I need to set up a Node.js app and here I need to setup MinIO

                    <span>Hi there,
 I remember seeing someplace around here a post about a project for a notification service for android (and IOS?) which would be selfhosted. It&#x27;s not Gotify although it could be relying on Gotify for the notification server.
 I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s a bit vague, I know it was posted in the last few months, 4 at most. If it rings a bell to any of you...

                    <span>So I have a number of self hosted apps in Proxmox LXC containers, all with unique IP addresses and hostnames.
 Radarr Sonarr Lidarr Etc....
 Instead of setting up ngnix / caddy on all my seperate containers I&#x27;m thinking of using a single reverse proxy / load balancer.
 If someone can recommend the best approach it would be really helpful.
 After looking at caddy, I&#x27;m leaning towards using it if it&#x27;s up from the task ? (....also wondering if caddy has a web GUI?)
 Thanks

                    <span>Im working on a project that allows you to inject ...
 invisible
 self-hosted
 encrypted
 
 dms
 group chats
 and guilds
 ... into the official discord webclient.
 Currently this does that by intercepting api calls for specific channels that the user sets, and injecting new messages into the websocket!
 Right now I&#x27;m cleaning up the code before I release a v1 version (plug and play program - one person hosts and others install and configs their clients)
 What I&#x27;m asking for you guys is feedback on how I should steer this project and anythings I should or shouldn&#x27;t do in particular.
 If you find this concept interesting you can keep an eye on my discord server where I work with others on this project - the invite code is HwNAW2UdYW (I would link it but its so we don&#x27;t get raided by bots - if u really want the invite DM me and I&#x27;ll send it tmrw)

 We&#x27;ve packaged a Qemu/KVM-based VM orchestration tool, which we&#x27;ve used internally for years, for general consumption. It is a dual-licensed and open source.
 We&#x27;d like to engage with a few serious beta-testers. While geared towards commercial usage, it can also run services and virtual servers in a home-lab setting.
 If anyone is up for giving it at spin, take a look at: https://www.origo.io/info/beta/

 Even though they are available Linux docker images, I thought some one would be interested to run these apps on Windows containers.
 Try it out and see if you like it and I would welcome your suggestions as well.

                    <span>Hi all! I&#x27;ve created a virtual switch on ESXi and then a port group for that switch to have my &quot;LAN&quot; for my VMs. Set up pfSense and it works fine from both sides (LAN and WAN). Now... Let&#x27;s pretend that my home network is 192.168.0.0 (which pfSense is connected on the WAN side on 192.168.0.x) and the lan side of pfSense is on another subnet, let&#x27;s say 192.168.20.0. I can access the Web UI from my home network using 192.168.0.x and through the VMs at the lan address. In order to access the lan side of pfSense from my home network I set up a static route in my PC setting up the WAN pfSense address as a gateway. It doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m sure is a &quot;dumb&quot; question, but I really haven&#x27;t got a clue. Any help? Love you people!

                    <span>I&#x27;m a long time user of (the free version of) Evernote. Since a while they have a restriction of 2 devices per (free) account and the fact I&#x27;m not hosting it myself makes me wonder if there is a (good) alternative? I will need Windows/Mac clients and iOS. Android support is a plus but not needed now. An export/import function would also be great. Saves me a lot of work... Browser plugin a big plus as well!
 Is there anything out there that does the job as good as Evernote?

                    <span>From outside, the services i self host are only available through a vpn with a certificate. So I can check who accesses the services but also what devices (i am the one that installs the certificate on the devices).
 I&#x27;d like to do the same for when people are inside my house, using my wifi. 
 That means restricting the access to my wifi to devices by using a certificate. And also enforcing some security on the device. E.g. 6 digits code, absence of some specific apps, etc. 
 Do you guys know how to do this ?
 Edit: no proprietary software please :)

                    <span>I have a windows machine and a openvpn server (vpn). I need to make a static route to force all traffic only through the VPN so if the VPN drops, my IP is not leaked.
 Ive done this before but using a third party VPN and softether on the windows machine to connect. I would remove the default 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.1 route, and create a persistent route to the VPN. When I connect to the VPN, it auto-updates my routing table so my default route goes through the VPN tunnel, and when I turn off the VPN, all traffic ends.
 Unforutnley I cant replicate this for OpenVPN, even after creating a default route to the OpenVPN IP, as well as the tunnel IP it assigns me, it still wont connect. I am unable to establish a connection unless the default 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.1 route is active (which I could remove afterwards, but this is a hassle and a leak if I forget)
 So why cant static default routes be made to the OpenVPN server, despite working with other VPN providers?

                    <span>Hey y&#x27;all. So this started out as a small project, but it ended up being waaay more complicated than I thought it was going to be. I cracked the screen on my Pixel 4a and I found out it was gonna cost $230 to repair. You know what I can buy for $230? Another phone. I def downgraded, but I don&#x27;t use my phone for much. So then I had this Pixel 4a that wasn&#x27;t even a year old that Amazon was going to pay me $20-60 for. 
 I really just wanted to wipe it and put Linux on it, but apparently that&#x27;s not actually a thing I can do like I can with a computer. And 4a isn&#x27;t ported to Ubuntu Touch yet. So I came across Linux Deploy. I&#x27;ve been needing to setup a backup server anyway.
 ANYWAY, this ended up becoming a whole thing because I had to find a work around for just about everything (because of chroot/Android/aarch64/etc.....). And I did! I even got it working with external storage and LVM!! I posted a tutorial on everything (split into two parts, because it gets hairy and LVM is optional). This is Debian in chroot running UrBackup. This project isn&#x27;t for everyone, especially because you&#x27;re limited to EXT4 and it only works with Windows and Linux clients (no Mac).
 But if you have an Android phone sitting around and you need a backup server, you can give it a swing:
 https://www.hannahtech.co/post/turn-your-old-cracked-android-phone-into-a-backup-server-urbackup-linux-deploy-tutorial-part-i
 The biggest con is that you are, at the end of the day, still running Android. You can disable most services and apps, but if you&#x27;re paranoid about Big Brother Google, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.

                    <span>Do you have to process data manually because it is served through images or scanned documents? An image-to-text conversion makes it possible to extract text from images to automate the processing of texts on images, videos, and scanned documents. In this article, we look at how to convert an image to text with React and Tesseract.js(OCR), preprocess images, and deal with the limitations of Tesseract (OCR).</span>

 I wanted ot ask, is there possibility to make wikijs to store uploaded files (images for instance) as original files, jpg for example? It looks for me, that it is converting them into objects in database and I wonder how to back up them, and I&#x27;m afraid that it will slow down my instance soon.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got an old RPi 3 that I&#x27;m trying to repurpose into a seedbox for my LAN, but I&#x27;m not having much luck. Can anyone help me?
 Working
  
qBittorrent web ui is accessible from other PCs, and can successfully download Linux ISOs.
  
Not Working
  
qBittorrent refuses to change the username/password from admin.
 I want to use filebrowser to access the torrented files via HTTP, but it refuses to run at all on the RPi. I think I got the armv7 build to run once, but after trying to install it as a service the way I did with qBittorrent, it crashes no matter how or where I run it.
 Though it felt like better practice to open the programs to Localhost and then proxy them to LAN subdomains using a server, I couldn&#x27;t figure out Caddy which supposedly would have made this easy
  
To do - Possibly Wireguard remote access in the future? I found a pretty good guide
 Any help or suggestions, particularly with getting Filebrowser (or an alternative) to run would be appreciated!
 Many thanks!

 I use Fresh RSS as my self hosted RSS reader. On my old phone I used readably as an app. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t available anymore.
 I tried the normal web view in the mobile browser, the FreshRSS app and FeedMe. All of them I did not quite like the look and feel.
 Which app can you recommend?

 How do I run shell commands or whatever in a jail? I hear everyone talking about running this command or that command in the jail but I&#x27;m sitting here thinking how TF do I do that.
 If anyone can help, it would be incredible.
 Oh and if u happen to know how to setup a java mc server in a jail, please refer me to a link tutorial or something. Even just a quick explanation.

                    <span>But when i tried to run the container with PIA running, the container couldnt create a network, so I turned off the vpn, and created the container, then turned the VPN back on. Is the container running under my vpn or not?

                    <span>Hello guys, I have an idea un mind. I’m going to provide free educational content. So I have some question:
 - Could I use a pi2 to self host it?
 - A free hosting service could be good? (Maybe I could get some type of financiation or ads?)
 ​
 *I have a static public IP
 *Pi2 is the only energy-efficient computer
 *Maybe I could have it 24/7
 *I don’t know anyway to hide my ip 
 *I don’t need to be in a search engine, as I can give the address to every class
 *Security is a must for my self hosted idea
 *I can get a SIM card with mobile data and host from there despite not being recommended 
 I won’t be hosting big files, just pdfs or images. Most of the contents would be linked to external pages (with permission from the author) Using ads won’t be bad I think (I’m a student so I won’t put ads that could distract people) but the ads should be 100% customisable (size, place And content?)
 Thanks again! You guys are the best community

                    <span>Hi guys, it&#x27;s my first post, so please be gentle. 
 I have a domain name called exampledomain.com that I would like to host a website on and ensure it&#x27;s encrypted etc using SSL. I&#x27;m hosting the website on godaddy at the moment.
 I also have another web server at home that I&#x27;d like to expose to the internet securely with SSL. I&#x27;d like this address to be store.exampledomain.com
 in GoDaddy&#x27;s DNS, I have an A record for store that points to my router at home.
 When it comes to SSL certificates, I&#x27;m confused how to implement this for both websites and more specifically, what type of cert I&#x27;ll need. Or will I need two certificates? I currently have a SAN cert with up to 5 SAN&#x27;s from godaddy.
 Generally, you need to submit a CSR to generate the cert from the server the website is on. So I do this on the server where exampledomain.com sits, then upload the CSR to godaddy and voila; I get my cert.
 However, now I want a cert for store.exampledomain.com so I need to go to my server at home hosting the website and generate a CSR for store. Is it just a matter of rekeying the certificate in GoDaddy now? Will that break the existing certificate for exampledomain.com?
 Any resources you could share that might educate me further would be helpful, also.
 So confused, eager to learn.

 I&#x27;m with an amateur radio group that provides communications for various races. Most of our activity takes place in areas with limited cell coverage, just off of wooded trails. Operators at the aid stations write down bib numbers and radio it into the race headquarters. We write down the report and give the time, location, and bib numbers to the race managers who check it off their master list. Family/friends of runners swarm around either us or race managers to find out how their runner is doing on the course. We&#x27;d (both us and race managers) would like to put a web page (or desktop app) on a tv screen to show where ru…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently migrated from a custom built mergerfs on ubuntu system to a Synology device. Whether this is an upgrade or not is in question, but I wanted a level of redundancy, a nicer heat solution and something which would just work so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about storage when selfhosting. 
 I&#x27;ve been using NFS for a while, with user accounts stored in AD. Pre-synology it worked great; realm join and we&#x27;re off and running. NFS with sec&#x3D;sys worked wonders because each user had the same uid/gid everywhere.
 My primary use cases are 2 docker hosts. I&#x27;d mount the nfs share on each host, then each container runs as a set user and only has access to their own directories. It&#x27;s magic. One mount and the rest takes care of itself.
 In this new synology world, it&#x27;s not as easy. It generates different uids than everything else on the network so sec&#x3D;sys doesn&#x27;t work. I had a stab at nfs idmapping and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Google is a mixed bag but the consensus is this isn&#x27;t the answer (and may even be a synology quirk).
 The answer seems to be either; 
  
chmod -R 777
 manage uids manually (ergh...)
 kerberos
 samba
  
I&#x27;m new to kerberos but I think I&#x27;m beginning to slowly get it. Is it worth it? 
 Kerberos &amp; Samba also may mean I need to manually mount each share under different user accounts. This feels cleaner but a relative pain in the arse.

                    <span>Hey I recently started using Cadvisor in combination with prometheus in Docker images, this works well, however I see that Cadvisor takes up a lot of RAM. probably because it has to monitor a lot of docker images (65 at the moment) and collect and forward information about them.. is there any suggestion how i can reduce this? is there maybe an environment variable i can use or a setting? my docker compose looks like this ( excluded prometheus and the grafana part. but I can share these also if needed)
 cadvisor: image: google/cadvisor network: - internal hostname: cadvisor volume: - /:/rootfs:ro - /var/run:/var/run:rw - /sys:/sys:ro - /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker:ro - /cgroup:/cgroup:ro deploy: tags: - org.label-schema.group&#x3D;monitoring

                    <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ve made a small script to easily get you started with LinuxServer.io applications using docker-compose. I personally find it very useful to quickly install an application and try it out. Hopefully it will help you too.
 The script getlsioapp.sh allows you to install a LinuxServer.io application in less than 10 seconds. It will automatically create the necessary volume directories on the host and automatically create the correct docker-compose configuration file. The docker-compose configuration file includes a description of all environment variables, volume- and port mappings.
 More info here.
 Let me know what you think!

I want them to be accessed outside but even though there os port forwarding option my ISP wont open 443 and 80 port so I decided to go with buying an vps and install wireguard and by that access all containers from anywhere . Now my question is , is there any VPS plan with less storage just for vpn , cheap price and doesnt need my information and accept payment via monero . I have checked orangewebsite njalla 1984hosting but I would need cheap one as I only use bandwidth and not much storage Thanks

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a few things running beind nginx proxy manager and they all work because the basic http(s)://IP:port request locally auto loads the desired location. For example, my nextcloud instance loads /index.php/login.
 I just installed an app (azuracast after reading the other thread), but the way that works is http(s)://x.x.x.x:port loads /login or /dashboard if you are logged in. Thats the admin dashboard but I am trying to expose the &quot;public&quot; page which is:
 http(s)://x.x.x.x:port/public/stationName 
 And the port is the same for the management dashboard. 
 Anyone know how to accomplish that with nginx proxy manager? When trying to use the custom locations setting I still just get directed to the main management page. nginx conf here https://pastebin.com/raw/rKM6kB3F

                    <span>I have an account for the oracle free tier, and I&#x27;ve been using one of the hosts to only host a teamspeak server, nothing else. I had the server running for almost a year, with no issues, until I started getting emails about abuse warning with the following message:
 Oracle has received notice of or detected unusual and potentially harmful activity originating from the indicated resource in your tenancy.
 Traffic Details: Outbound Port Scanning, Brute-forcing, Web Exploitation, and/or DDoS 
 I unfortunately do not have a support subscription, so I am unable to log a ticket to inquire about it. 
 I&#x27;ve tried some of the basic security controls they suggest like making sure OS is up to date, disable password login, change ssh port. I also installed sshguard and fail2ban to help make sure my machine is more secure.
 They have since disabled the host, but I am able to clone the boot volume and then make a new instance from that clone to still have my vm, but then it&#x27;s around a week or two until it gets disabled and I have to repeat this.
 I have no idea where to start looking or what to do to address this issue? I would greatly appreciate if anyone has any advice or help on what I can do to resolve this.

 Is there any billing/management software for such ? I am not very keen to use wiregaurd, so even if I had to switch to OpenVPN or similar, I&#x27;ll have no problem.

                    <span>I have all of my domains on GoDaddy (not my original choice but it works for everything else so I am not interested in switching) and their Ultimate Linux Hosting package which includes cPanel and SSH access as well as the regular GoDaddy management tools. 
 I have a few subdomains that I use for things like Nextcloud, Gitea, etc. that I host on a server in my basement.
 When I try to issue an SSL cert using Let&#x27;s Encrypt, I have to issue it on GoDaddy and then have to install the certs through cPanel, and then copy those certs from cPanel to my server for HTTPS to work. When I try to issue the certs directly on my server, HTTPS does not work. Basically this is the breakdown:
  
SSH into cPanel.
 
Run acme.sh and create the cert.
 
Copy the cert information to the SSL manager in cPanel.
 
Copy those same certs to my SSL folder on my server at home.
 
Update my home webserver&#x27;s vhost config to point to the correct server.
 
SSL is now set up and HTTPS should be working correctly. Repeat steps 1-4 to update the cert.
 
 Is this behavior correct or am I doing something wrong? I have an A record in my GoDaddy DNS for each subdomain (nextcloud.domain.tld, git.domain.tld) and don&#x27;t have any files on GoDaddy itself; if I were to shut off my port forward you wouldn&#x27;t see anything at all. Yet the SSL certs have to be managed through cPanel first, then copied to my webserver for https to work.

                    <span>This is my Homer dashboard, work of about 4 months. I didn&#x27;t know anything about QNAP, docker or images at all, and now I can say that I&#x27;m pretty familiar with it :-)
 I am still looking for a solution/docker image where I can &#x27;drag/drop&#x27; files so that they are uploaded directly to my &#x27;nas&#x27; (the host on which docker / the image will then run).
 so if you have any suggestions please!

                    <span>Hey guys. Sorry if this is not the most appropriate subreddit for this type of question, but I feel kinda lost here.
 So, I&#x27;m using a RPI4 to self host a discord bot I developed, along with some (micro)services the bot depends on, all running on docker. 
 I managed to setup github actions to test, build and deploy the nodejs services on docker hub and everything is working fine. However, I&#x27;d like to up the ante a little and accomplish a fully automated deploying system. Right now, after the new docker images are pushed to docker hub, I still need to manually SSH into the RPI and use docker-compose to pull and run the containers again.
 My question is: how can I &quot;trigger&quot; my RPI to auto pull the new images (and run the containers again) after gihub actions pushes to docker hub?
 PS: I&#x27;ve heard of watchtower, and while that does work, it&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. Since it runs on a schedule, it doesn&#x27;t update the images right after they&#x27;re pushed to docker hub. Also, I&#x27;m aware that docker has put on some limits to pulls/day for free users, so that would make the watchtower rollouts even slower.
 Sorry for the somewhat long post, and thanks in advance!

                    <span>With google phasing out unlimited storage, and locking features behind a google one subscription, I am looking for a alternative.
 I am looking for a foss alternative to google photos. I would prefer it to have a webapp or apps for Mac, android, iOS, windows- almost everything. I also want the app to function as a gallery app, much like google photos on Android. 
 The main feature I am looking for is for Ai face, thing, and place recognition. With pretrained models or self training. (So if it doesn&#x27;t recognize something I could teach it to with pictures.)
 A lot of the ones I have been looking for don&#x27;t have the ai feature, which really makes me exit the tab.
 Comment if you find/know of any software like this.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hey guys,
 so recently I asked myself how you build these binary files files for full stack applications.
 Take Plex as an example, if you go on their website you can download a server file as an binary compatible with your system (.exe, .dmg, .sh, etc), which includes the webversion of Plex and the whole backend. So I was wondering how you are able to do that, since it will probably also help with building single docker images instead of stacks which I currently use to combine frontend and backend. 
 Does anyone know how its done or know an open source example for the building process?
 Thanks for the help!

                    <span>The title is very cryptic, but I&#x27;m looking for open source form software, which can be selfhosted and has these features:
 - Logged in users can access the form, fill out the fields, place signature, upload pictures.
 - Make fields manditory and non-manditory
 - A review feature, which allows a user to view all entered data
 - Place two signature fields at the end, after data is reviewed
 - Also allows sending the form to an external user (anonymous user, will not log in, so needs a unique URL), the pre-filled form including one of the signatures should be visible (non-editable), and only allow the second signature to be placed.
 - Logged in users can see the previously filled out forms, edit and resubmit the form/save it
 - Completed forms can be sent to a mailbox in PDF format
 - The anonymous user can fill out an email address at the end of the form, to be able to send the PDF to an extra email address (his own, or the site manager for example)
 - There is a format in which we&#x27;d like to make the PDF where the different entered fields can be replaced, I can build it in JS/PHP and also have a Word format.
 The software is used to make work reports after a days work on site, and requires a signature of the worker and the project manager on site. The project manager sometimes needs to review, hence the email-review-feature.
 I&#x27;ve tried DocAssemble, which got me really far, but the last few steps (including reviewing, sending email and returning to the form without having a user to log in) I wasn&#x27;t able to accomplish, even with some help from the community there, I do use DocAssemble for other forms, I do love the flexibility of it.
 ​
 Any help, opinions and pointers in a direction would be greatly appreciated!

 I imagine we already have a backup software with Web UI, so we can:
  
create a backup job
 point to some directory or give DB login credentials
 pick the backup time
 set the compression
 set the backup destination, local or remote (S3, FTP, ...)
  
Do you know any backup software that has these features? If not, would you support (code or donation) the development of this software?

                    <span>Goal: force all traffic through VPN only.
 Client: Windows in VM
 VPN: OPENVPN
 I delete the 0.0.0.0 route in the client. I make a route for the destination of my VPN server with my LAN default gateway as the gateway (192.168.1.1). So, in practice when I turn on openvpn, it attempts to connect to the server IP which has a route through my local LAN gateway, which would result in a connection and a new VPN connection established. And when the VPN connection drops, all traffic stops.
 However, I am unable to connect to the VPN server. I can ping it though. I was able to replicate the same scenario in a windows VM with softether client and a third party VPN and can connect successfully. What am I doing wrong?

                    <span>Hello,
  
UPDATE: I now have this working. When you are proxying a single host the cloudflared daemon creates the DNS entries for you. When you are using a config file you must create the DNS entries manually. You can either do this at cloudflare.com or use the command line: 
 # cloudflared tunnel route dns xxxxxxx-1356-xxxx-af44-237e463731 music.example.nz 
 Here is the documentation I missed. Hopefully my mistake means that somebody else gets it easy. :-) 
 UPDATE 2: SSH access is a little more complicated as there is no port 22 available on CloudFlare and you can&#x27;t get to the Docker host via ssh://localhsot:22 from inside a container. There are actually good docs on how to do this, I just missed them. 
  
I have the sad reality of being stuck behind a CGNAT setup at home, and so CloudFl…</span>

 It should be much faster in general. Take a look at the changes below. Each are documented.

                    <span>I am planning to go back to school and looking for a note taking app. Found Joplin and it seems to be a nice app. I have been using it on my laptop and synced it with my Nextcloud account. However, it made a mess on the root folder of my Files directory.
 Is there a way to clean it up and not break the synchonization? Something like a Joplin directory and dump all the *.md files in there instead of the root of the main Files directory.
 ​
 EDIT:
 It is working now or should I say I was able to dump all the the Joplin files into its own directory. I tried this at first before posting, but it didn&#x27;t work. I might have typo&#x27;d url. Anyways, thanks for the folks who suggested it.

                    <span>Hello guys, so I&#x27;ve changed from gmail to protonmail and I *think* I want to step over to own domain.
 Currently I&#x27;m using something like this:
 [email1@pm.me](mailto:email1@pm.me) - Personal /Banking account
 [email2@pm.me](mailto:email2@pm.me) - Gaming / Twitch / Steam etc account
 I see a lot of people using custom domainst, but I have a some questions.
  
Is possible that someone steals my domain or get my email redirecting to them ?
 Is the price of the domain going to be the same or higher ?
 In protonmail can I do (imagine) 100 alias to the email or I need to pay more than the plus?
 Is the whois privacy safe? Or do i need to cheat in the real information?
 I&#x27;ve seen that some people get their domain hijacked by a company, is that easy to do with every domains? I&#x27;ll be getting a .me
 Is the only &quot;disadvantage&quot; is that we always have to pay it?

                    <span>I created my openvpn server using the openvpn stack on oracle cloud ( https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/adf.task-flow?adf.tfId&#x3D;adhtf&amp;adf.tfDoc&#x3D;/WEB-INF/taskflow/adhtf.xml&amp;application_id&#x3D;72305905 )
 Id like to create a static route so all my client traffic only goes through the vpn. However there isnt an option to write these console commands as root such as &quot;push &quot;redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp&quot;, it only allows you to ssh in as the user &quot;openvpnas&quot;. Because of this, is there a way to make these &quot;redirect-gateway def1&quot; changes via the openvpn admin portal or fiddling with the oracle &quot;virtual cloud network&quot; rules/settings?

                    <span>Hi Everyone!
 I&#x27;m pissed off about StandardNotes&#x27; new syncing server. It now requires Docker ( I use LXC) and it spawns 7 different containers just so that I can sync some notes between my laptop and my phone. I was wondering if there are other selfhosted alternatives that I can switch over to.
 Here are my requirements for such platform:
  
Encrypted notes/storage
 MacOS/Windows app and native Android/iOS app
 Built-in ability to keep the notes synced, ideally without having to set up another service to do this (like nextcloud, webdav, etc.)
  
​
 Any recommendations are highly appreciated.

                    <span>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a moron and could very well be &#x27;reinventing the wheel here&#x27;.
 In my limited free time, I play around in a homelab for the learning experience, love of the game, etc. I&#x27;m trying to migrate away from Docker in favor of deploying web servers &amp; services on virtualized &#x27;bare metal&#x27; ;).
 To summarize:
  
Homelab: 1 WAN IP
 VM #1: Docker host, LetsEncrypt (aka SWAG) as my reverse proxy
 VM #2: NextCloud host via LEMP Stack (nginx)
 etc...
  
What I want to do:
  
Keep VM#1 UP: my &#x27;production&#x27; reverse proxy (Existing NGiNX/LetsEncrypt, which I use heavily) 
 
Create additional &#x27;web servers&#x27; as if VM#1 didn&#x27;t exist:
  
Multiple NGiNX/Apache instances
 Allow certbot/letsencrypt packages to act on their own, as if my production instance wasn&#x27;t in effect.
 
  
IE: My NextCloud VM. I want to run certbot/letsencrypt to acquire it&#x27;s own SSL certificate, but I&#x27;m not sure how that would work. 
 Would a simple proxy_pass without SSL to the test VM&#x27;s do it? I want to be sure before moving forward. 
 Is this possible? 
  
If so, any tips or pointers are welcome! 
 If I&#x27;m not making sense, I welcome the ridicule.

                    <span>Hey Folks!
 I have been trying to learn/figure out how I can self-host at home, I do that that I&#x27;m stuck behind CGNAT, so after following this sub I felt like the way to go would be VPS (Wireguard Server) --&gt; RaspberryPi (Wireguard Client) and then run Nginx Proxy Manager on the client. I&#x27;ve been trying to follow the materials here:
  
https://www.selfhosted.pro/hl/wireguard_vps/
 https://forums.lawrencesystems.com/t/getting-started-building-your-own-wireguard-vpn-server/7425
  
Along with various other googling and trials and error :) 
 But it feels like I must be missing some step with either the Wireguard or Nginx setup.
 For initial testing, I was trying to connect to my domain (tied to the VPS) and then use that domain within Nginx Proxy Manager, however, when I put the domain in I can get to the Nginx Proxy Manager Default page but can never get anything else to work.
 Any help is appreciated.

                    <span>Hi there,
 I am looking to host a small personal NAS on a raspberry pi, instead of port forwarding (Our IP changes frequently) I was looking at using Telebit cloud (https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/telebit.js) I am just wondering what people think of the security aspects of this service.
 From testing its super easy to setup and use, providing I can protect the nextcloud interface with relevant brute force protection then I am just looking for security advice from the tunnelling point of view.
 How secure would this method be for connecting to a NAS?

                    <span>Hi all - I&#x27;m new to self-hosting so please correct me if I make any mistakes here.
 I&#x27;m looking into buying some hardware to host some tools on, and I&#x27;m here looking for some recommendations on what kind of specs I need to look for in a server.
 Initially I&#x27;m going to look into setting up a matrix synapse instance to bridge to slack, fb messenger and discord, and a system for SMS forwarding. Assuming that goes to plan, I would then like to expand to an implementation of Mycroft.ai and a couple of CCTV cameras and door open / glass break sensors for home security on the same server.
 Although I will go with the most cost efficient method to achieve these goals, I want to have plenty of scope to get all this up and running smoothly, so price and energy requirements aren&#x27;t of particular concern. What sort of devices should I be looking into? A single server dealing with all of it, an array of raspberry pis, would I be better off hiring a VPS, etc? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I&#x27;m looking for some kind of notepad++ / codeserver alternative to edit my xml (yaml) files on my docker host online.
 does anyone have a docker image/suggestion?
 I am NOT looking for a nextcloud solution, just a quick way to edit my files on the NAS, online
 it&#x27;s cool if it can also recognize yaml / xml etc and show it that way

                    <span>Hi everybody,
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has been able to create some cool seamless design across all their apps.
 This because I see that everyone share their custom, personal dashboards, with some really good eye candy, but they lack into do the same with apps.
 One big advantage about self hosting is that almost every piece of software is web software, allowing us to modify the look with some custom HTML/CSS and even JavaScript without the needed of compiling.
 So if you take care of the eye candy of your apps, I would be happy to see any of your configs, so feel free to share a picture of that. :D
 Peace.

                    <span>I have openvpn access server on oracle cloud, and local client on my win 7 pc. I want to create a static route so all internet traffic only flows through the VPN, and nothing else. Ive been able to do this with softether and a third-party VPN service, but I cant get it to work with OpenVPN. 
 Id delete the 0.0.0.0 route. Then I would make a route in cmd with the destination network my VPN and the gateway my local LAN gateway ie: route add [VPN IP] mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.1. Id connect to my VPN using softether client, which populates a IPV4 address and default gateway for my VPN adaptor, and in turn generates a route for all traffic to flow through this VPN adaptor, the route shows as: 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [VPN gateway] [VPN interface]. 
 Trying to replicate this procedure, but with openvpn server and open client I am unable to connect. Note: I am able to connect if I reset the routing table, but this defeats the purpose as I want all traffic to only go through the VPN&#x27;s IP.

 i&#x27;m looking to find a registrar that offer dnssec (not external) and whois protection, real whois protection not like cloudflare or gandi with data redacted and state/country visible. 
 tld is .com
 it seems that namecheap has these requirements but years ago i registered a domain with them and i received emails advertising of their products that i never requested. i would like to keep namecheap as last option.
 i was looking at google domains but I don&#x27;t understand if their whois protection is &quot;full&quot; or show state/country.
 any advice is greatly appreciated.

As it is running on the same server as my caddy instance it is using port 4433 instead of 443. How would I set up a reverse proxy within caddy to proxy test.example.com:4433 to test.example.com:443 (through caddy) using the https cert that already exists on test.example.com:4433. All the documentation I have seen for caddy reverse proxy is for when you have a http site that you want to reverse proxy and it doesnt have a cert already.

 I was wondering if anyone had some insight on doing a self-hosted version?
 I&#x27;m not all that familiar myself with building Docker images - maybe it&#x27;s my own fault for relying on this too much. But what I&#x27;m after is perhaps hosting my projects on a self hosted Git server (Gitea maybe?) then when that&#x27;s updated, it gets built and pushed to a self hosted repo.

                    <span>For almost 7 years I have run my own email server sending and receiving emails on it&#x27;s own IP address. A few years ago I switched to Digital Ocean as a VPS to reduce deliverability issues, recently the IP block I was in got blacklisted by zen.spamhaus. Given that I have often suggested people use a SMTP relay I though I would share my experience of not being the target customer any more. They used to advertise SMTP relays as what they are, a relay service, they no longer do that. Now as a selfhoster I felt like a square peg in a round hole.
 Big players really make it hard for small servers
 As outlined with this blog post Google is eating out email and the resulting discussion on Hacker News the big players appear to have no interest following the standard rules when it comes to emails. A…</span>

                    <span>Hello, everyone,
 Learning lots from this sub, and hoping to pay it forward in the future. Unfortunately I’m here with a dumb question instead regarding self hosting my apps.
 Let’s say my docker container is running all my apps and is on 192.169.1.1 It’s my understanding that the only way to expose these services outside my network is by forwarding port 80 to that IP in my router settings, correct? Is there any other way? I ask because I don’t want to do this, and just want a little piece of mind after all this tinkering. 
 I can’t access them from outside my network that I know of, however, I’m running ssl on all of them so technically am I not exposing them somewhat by navigating to something like photoprism.mydomain.com?
 Thanks for any help,

                    <span>The situation is as follows:
 I have a MediaWiki installed on a Debian server. The Wiki is installed on Apache2
 For information, the changes I made in the LocalSettings.php file is as follows:
 $wgScriptPath &#x3D; &quot;/mediawiki&quot;; $wgServer &#x3D; &quot;http://192.168.100.5:8080&quot;;
 In the internal network, when I type in the local IP address of the MediaWiki server (192.168.100.5:8080) I get to the default page of Apache where it says that it works.
 But when I type /mediawiki behind it, (192.168.100.5:8080/mediawiki), I get to the main page of the Wiki.
 I have put this server behind a reverse proxy (Caddy) so that it&#x27;s accessible from the outside world. 
 The Caddyfile config is as follows:
 mydomain.com:443 { reverse_proxy 192.168.100.5:8080 }
 But when I type in the domain, I can only see the Apache Default page. I also can not get to the MediaWiki if I put /mediawiki behind the URL.
 Does anyone know how I can make it so that whenever I go to my domain, that it automatically goes to the main page of the MediaWiki, (which in the local network would be 192.168.100.5:8080/mediawiki as stated earlier). Or does anyone know where I should look? Any help is appreciated.
 Thank you so much in advance!

                    <span>Voice assistants are currently the most popular use case for voice user interfaces. However, due to the bad feedback loop resulting from voice assistants can only solve simple user tasks such as setting an alarm or playing music. In order for voice user interfaces to really break through, feedback to the user must be visual, not auditive.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently started looking into Minecraft server hosting, and I want to host a 24/7 Java and Bedrock (using GeyserMC plugin) but I&#x27;m not sure what hosting to to with. I&#x27;ve experimented with self hosting and have got that to work and everything, however I don&#x27;t want to have my personal pc running 24/7. I&#x27;ve looked into Pebblehost but I saw that it&#x27;s virtual and that I might have to use terminal, which I&#x27;m not sure about; I&#x27;m used to windows and its simplicity, however I don&#x27;t know where to start with hosting and the thought of using Linux frightens me (lol). Can anyone recommend me a good service to use or reassure me that I would be able to use Pebblehost? Either will work lmao, thanks for reading I guess
 TL;DR need server help pls Pebblehost scary Apex overpriced need server 24/7 for friends

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m setting up my ebook server. I decided to use calibre-web - https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web as a docker container and to be honest, it confuses me a lot. Documentation is not very good so I decided to ask more experienced self hosters about a few things.
 Is it just gui for browsing ebooks? I cannot find any &quot;add&quot; button, so I&#x27;m not sure if it is supposed to work similar to regular calibre, or is it just browsing frontend? How can I add new book? Should I also have calibre in parallel, that will use the same database as calibre-web from the mentioned above git repository?
 Second question? Is it possible to host audiobooks with calibre-web?

                    <span>I use Rocketbook and the Rocketbook app to write handwritten notes, the app only saves to cloud services like dropbox, so the only alternative is to email them to myself and then manually move the notes to Syncthing
 Here is what im trying to do:
 - I will create an email address that is only used for me to send myself attachments i want saved in Syncthing
 - have my ubuntu server automatically check that email, maybe every 15 minutes or 20 minutes or something
 - if it detects the email is from my specific email address, download the attachment
 - copy the attachment to my syncthing folder on the server
 ​
 does anyone know of any programs that can automate email checking on a server? thanks

                    <span>I need a simple docker application that monitors an IP address and sends email notifications whenever the state changes (client goes offline &gt; online and vice versa).
 Tried Statping already, found it out to be too resource extensive (Ubuntu Server 20.04 on Q6600, statping along consumes around 40% RAM with just 5 hosts enabled).
 ​
 Edit : Forgot to mention some of the devices being monitored include ESP8266 and other IOT Stuff (Garden Sprinklers) that wake up only once in a while and support no SNMP.

                    <span>Hello there!
 Today i installed Heimdall, because it looked nice and i wanted a quick way to access all my selfhosted apps.
 But after the installation (docker) i wanted to add an app and i&#x27;ve seen in a few youtube videos, that heimdall is suggesting names if you type in the application name and also does create cards for supported apps.
 But this does not work somehow.
 For example i wanted to add plex, so i type in plex in application name and from what i have seen is that i should suggest &quot;Plex&quot; from a dropdown list and also create an card for plex automatically, because it is an supported app (Checked on apps.heimdall.site)
 I also tried the &quot;update app list&quot; button a few times, but didn&#x27;t work and after that i download the Plex.zip from the heimdall-apps github site manually and unzipped it to config/www/supported apps, but nothing did work as expected.
 ​
 Do i miss anything?
 Hope someone can help me :)

                    <span>A ton of time is not something I have. With that said, QNAP container station app doesn&#x27;t seem to automatically update Docker images without losing the data. Anyone else use a QNAP have a solution to updating the images without breaking everything? I&#x27;d rather not run another server for this right now since I lack the time.

                    <span>Hello gentlemen, hello ladies,
 I am searching for something capable of monitoring a web page, but in a &quot;smart&quot; way. When I monitor this page manually, I need to click to a couple of buttons in order to know if there have been any changes (in my case, if there is any disponibility of this certain product). For this reason, I cannot use extensions like &quot;Refresh &amp; Monitor&quot;, because I would need the tool to perform these actions before checking if a certain line of text appeared. Also, I would need this tool to have very short checking intervals, like no more than 5 seconds. Any ideas?

                    <span>I would like to be able to see logs from a node backend and possibly a frontend I created though a web interface. The issue is, I have a shared web host, and I would like to stay solely on that if possible (not have to rent a VPS just for this).
 Are there any log collectors / analyzers like greylog which are able to run just with either PHP , Node, Ruby or Python and a MySQL database? All the ones I found required to install it as software.
 Thanks!

                    <span>My company&#x27;s server generates large data dumps ( 200gb+ ) and logs every hour and I need to download them automatically to my local computer storage as soon as they are generated, I have a sketchy power supply in my area and hence the downloads get abrupted fairly often and thus I need the partial downloads to resume automatically, in addition I need the files to get deleted from their original location as soon as they are fully downloaded.
 The remote computer is a mac and my local computer is a windows machine.
 I have tried Syncthing, but its speed varies a lot and often times I catch it either at a very low speed or at zero speed.
 I am fairly novice to programming, would be great if I can get a tool, script or directions to think this programmatically.

                    <span>Hi,
 I want to upgrade my mediacenter/server home setup and I want to implement a solution with unraid.
 My objective is keep low as possible the power consumption, and have enough capacity to run 5/6 VM (one, with an huge plex library).
 I have looking for a lot of possible configurations, and these two I think are the more adeguate.
 I would know your opinion about it and if you have any suggestion (on compatibility as well) is it really welcome.
 ​
 Thanks

                    <span>TLDR
  
I was wondering, what are your strategies to mitigate egress data transfer costs?
 
Also, does anyone know if there exists some kind of firewall that I can install on my servers so that it would keep an eye on the egress data transfer and cap outward bandwidth down to a fixed Mbps amount after a limit (say 1TB out) has been reached?
 
 Motivation
 Hi guys, I am a 4th year Software Eng student and in the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been researching and learning about cloud technologies and services. It seems to me that cloud computing and data storage are relatively cheap, or at least you can find ways to mitigate the costs (e.g. spot instances, S3 storage classes etc..). On the other hand egress data transfer costs really bug me:

                    <span>I’ve recently been looking for a SOHO document management system that can OCR and index PDFs. 
 I used to use PaperPort (came free with a scanner a lifetime ago) and was very happy with everything except remote access and the need to keep a PC running to host it.
 I’ve since moved through Googledrive, OneDrive and Owncloud and have yet to find something that works as well for me as PaperPort did. 
 Ideally I’d like something that can run on a Synology NAS, has a good web GUI and supports mobile devices as clients (the wife has an iPhone 12 and a Samsung tablet). I need to maintain an offsite backup copy (I have a synology ds1515+ and a ds713+ with ds513 that makes it the same size as the ds1515+ for local backups) and am happy to use a VPS for snapshots etc in case of ransomware. 
 My primary need is to scan to PDF and have those PDFs OCR’d and indexed so I can easily find and print anything I need. Add to that things like PDF downloads such as MagPI and HackSpace magazines and manuals for everything I own and it becomes a complete repository with no need for a nay paper files. 
 Do you do anything like this for your documents and what do you recommend?

                    <span>Anyone know of any good, open source solutions for a DNS server which has a nice, decent, intuitive WebUI for DNS management? Something similar to the way CloudFlare works? Ive been meaning to testout DNS Manager from ISP manager . Windows doesn&#x27;t have an HTML version of DNS server yet does it? (I know said open source but just curious).
 Alternatively, and maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding this, but maybe an IPAM solution would be good too. Is IPAM where I manage my IPs/DHCP and DNS all in one? I always find it tedious and annoying AF to have to make a static DHCP reservation and then create a second DNS record with the ZeroShell Router i have. Would be sweet to have it all bundled together since IP address management and DNS are so tied together at the end of the day,
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hey guys,
 I have a single proxmox machine with multiple VMs, one of them being a file server/Plex and another hosting all my docker containers. The docker host was running on Alma Linux, but for some reason the virtual HDD has corrupted itself twice. Luckily I have backups but honestly I think I&#x27;m just gonna swap OSes. Any suggestions? I&#x27;m preferably looking for an RPM based OS but I&#x27;m open to switching.

 I checked the domain on MX Toolbox&#x27;s blacklist check, and it isn&#x27;t listed at all, FWIW.

                    <span>Literally how!? I&#x27;ve read about a lot of people using docker to run containers and storing all the big data on a NAS. While I run into endless problems trying to do this.
 Sure, apps that need read-only access (Plex/Jellyfin) have no problem. I add the NAS mount on the host and then bind mount the media folder into docker. No problem.
 But what about web apps that wants to write data? Nextcloud, WebDAV, etc.
 They start up and throw a fit that they couldn&#x27;t chown everything under the sun:
 chown: /var/lib/dav/data: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav/data: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav/DavLock: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav: Operation not permitted
 I&#x27;ve tried with NFS and CIFS, simple permissions, POSIX permissions, matching accounts, UIDs...
 
 I think my permissions are OK becuase I see that the app created a whole bunch of files in the NAS directory, but I guess couldn&#x27;t chown them. 
 Any advice?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a newbie to Sonarr so apologies if there&#x27;s supposed to be an easy fix. I tried google and the FAQ section but none of them seemed to help.
 So I have a linux host and a linux server (which is basically just an old laptop running Arch without a GUI). I&#x27;ve installed sonarr on the server, and the host machine can load the sonarr webpage though my local network. However, when I try to download a show, I need to add a download path and it only displays my host filesystem. I want to download shows to my server, but don&#x27;t see an option for that even though both Sonarr and the webpage are hosted on the server.
 Also when I go to the Sonarr settings page, I can see that my server hard drive under Disk Space. I&#x27;m not sure why it doesn&#x27;t give me the option to save to it.

                    <span>I am using nginx as a reverse proxy for my dockerized applications. I tried both with and without dockerizing and both work. Now I am curious why I should chose one above the other? Is a dockerized reverse proxy more secure than a bare nginx (e.g. installed with &#x60;apt&#x60;, &#x60;dnf&#x60;, ...)?
 What are your opinions and where can I find more information?

                    <span>Just seeing if anyone on this sub uses or has made an employee in / out board. Currently we use a magnetic white board to indicate if employees are in or out of the office but with more and more people working from home this just does not work. Hoping someone has some suggestions.

 Does anyone know any good self-hosted documentation software? I&#x27;m looking for something similar to Docusaurus. It&#x27;ll be for hosting primarily legal documentation and policies, a site like https://docs.github.com/en. Preferably with a modern UI too.

                    <span>Hey guys,
 Thought I&#x27;d share my most recent creation: autodockerdash
 ​
 https://reddit.com/link/o1581t/video/azamirmjsm571/player
 It started as a little dashboard project, which is something I want this to grow into, but for now, it just displays docker container statuses.
 It&#x27;s a simple server that will connect to your docker socket, get some stats on the containers, and if they have some specific labels, will display them on the dashboard. Includes the ability to display dependent &quot;child&quot; containers, useful to make sure that your app is running if it needs to include a DB etc.
 https://github.com/Inlustra/auto-docker-dash
 It&#x27;s a little heavy handed and hasn&#x27;t been tested super-well. It will auto update in the background using websockets though it is a server side rendered SPA, so you don&#x27;t *need* Javascript.
 If you have any feature requests or comments, let me know or post on the github repo.

                    <span>I created a OpenVPN server using Oracle cloud. They have a marketplace image of OpenVPN and it creates a Oracle Ubuntu instance with OpenVPS installed. During the creation process it asks for my public key so I create one using PuttyGEN and copy / paste actually as shown (its RSA 2048 bit) and I was able to create the VPS succssfully. 
 Then with putty I attach the private key, and enter my username (ubuntu) and VPS IP to SSH in. I get the error message &quot;putty error: PuTTY Fatal Errror. No supported authentication methods available ( server sesnt: publickey) &quot; 
 I am following these guides exactly:
 https://k21academy.com/1z0-932/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-pair-for-oracle-cloud-windows-linux/
 https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/launching-your-own-free-private-vpn-in-the-oracle-cloud 
 Any idea what I am doing wrong? I have repeated the entire process almost 12 times now and the issue remains. 
 Note: The oracle blog link is outdated, the instance creation is different now then the images shown. In the blog it shows an option to generate SSH keys during the instance creation process, but this is not present when I create my instance, it only asks to enter my public SSH key (optional), which is why im using PuTTYGEN.

 I get the concerns for privacy etc when using cloud or other providers, and understand the 3-2-1 rules of backups, but given how often my media server has some issue that is big enough to leave it offline until I manually fix it, trusting anything like this is difficult. How do you guys feel &quot;confident&quot; in your self hosted backups?

Please don&#x27;t ask &quot;well why not docker?&quot;, that&#x27;s not the point of this post (thank you) but the short answer is that I&#x27;m installing inside of an LXC and much prefer LXC to docker for ease of management within Proxmox. 
 Wasn&#x27;t able to find anything other than compiling from source, seems a bit odd! Thanks for your help in advance!

                    <span>Hi All,
 I am trying to host synapse server and use nginx as a reverse-proxy server.
  
The synapse server is running fine and is accessible when I use localhost:8008. Note, 8008 port is used for the synapse server.
 The nginx server is running fine locally as I can access localhost , also using the internet as I can access my domain server www.mydomain.com .
  
I have setup nginx config in the following way
 location /matrix { proxy_pass http://localhost:8008/; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; client_max_body_size 2000M; } 
 to access the synapse server when I use www.mydomain.com/matrix.
 Now, the problem is when I use www.mydomain.com/matrix, my url in the address bar becomes www.mydomain.com/_matrix/static and gives 404 error (page does not exit).
 ​
 I think I need to change &quot;webroot&quot; somewhere either in the homeserver.yml Or nginx.conf to redirect url to the right local synapse server.
 ​
 Any help will be appreciated.
 Thanks

 I just migrated from the legacy Ruby server to the new JS server with my docker-compose setup, and wanted to post examples of my &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; for anyone who is interested. I exported my notes in the web UI and moved my database to a backup before wiping it to allow it to initialize fresh. I then imported the notes back in the web ui without any problems.

                    <span>Hi, first of all I&#x27;m kinda new to self-hosting, and to linux in general, and I&#x27;m in the process of setting up a home server using an old PC I had laying around
 I followed this tutorial, which launches a docker image using this command :
 sudo docker run \ --name&#x3D;heimdall \ -e PUID&#x3D;1001 \ -e PGID&#x3D;1001 \ -e TZ&#x3D;America/New_York \ -p 7888:80 \ -p 4443:443 \ -v ~/.config/heimdall/:/config \ --restart unless-stopped \ linuxserver/heimdall 
 Now it&#x27;s running, but I didn&#x27;t have to set up a .yml file and don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s wrong to do so. 
 From what I understand it is used to configure easily the container, so now I can&#x27;t do so because I don&#x27;t know where the yml is...
 I am also trying to install PiHole but don&#x27;t know how to, using a yml.
 Can you explain how it works, or how I should do ?
 Thanks

                    <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve just released the first version of my new inventory system to help anyone who needs to track &quot;stuff&quot; log where it is and how much they have of it.
 You can download the source from https://github.com/proffalken/mventory and there are docker containers for AMD64, ARMv6, ARMv7, and ARM64 so it should run on just about any hardware.
 It&#x27;s entirely API-driven, although you can use the Django Admin interface if you want a GUI for adding components, and at the moment it just lists items by location - search will be coming soon.
 I&#x27;m hoping to integrate it with octopart in future as well, and I&#x27;d love other people to get involved even if it&#x27;s writing a GUI in another language that talks to the API!
 Let me know what you think!

 I have a brick and mortar store, and we&#x27;re doing some local delivery based on calls. I wanted to expand this to online, and see what is available. Most sites like shopify have plugins that allow for easy local delivery management (like this: Local Delivery ). I&#x27;m trying to find a similar solution but self-hosted. Does anyone know of a plugin for any self-hosted platform that can help manage this? I haven&#x27;t decided on any single ecommerce platform just yet, mainly because I want to find the best option for this problem in particular.
 Basically just looking for scheduling deliveries based on customer location!

 I self host nearly all the services my community uses (except email). 
 I am going to start adding - cameras (5-8) - wind sensors (3-5) - temperature and humidity sensors (10-15) - liquid level sensors (5-8) - batteries connected to solar panels (5-8)
 And or course I will want to gather in real time data from those devices and to store them on my linux server. 
 Is there an open &quot;communication standard&quot; i should look for when buying these sensors, to make sure I will be able to poll them and integrate everything in my database ?
 Is there a FOSS application server side that can use this protocol and display nice graphs ?
 Thanks

                    <span>Hi!
 I live near a small airfield as well as an international airport. I use FlightRadar24 a lot as it is the most well refined but it always annoys me that I cannot see military aircraft flying over me on there. We also have classic fighter aircraft fly from my small airfield (jets and warbirds) and often FR24 also blocks those out.
 I have tried using ADSB Exchange but the coverage around here isn&#x27;t perfect and the Web UI is a hot mess on mobile which makes using it rather unpleasant.
 I have a server rack, a VPN to my home setup as well as the radio kit I would need to host my own ADSB radar but I would like to know.
 Is there a way I can feed FR24 or 360 Radar/ADSB Exchange and my own personal radar view? It would be nice to help increase the spotty coverage in my area but I would also like a raw radar view of the data with no filtering of any aircraft. Is this possible?
 Either way what is the best radar view software to use for this kinda application? 
 I have an RTL-SDR (one of those USB TV stick things) and would like to pass it through to a VM in ESXi (if possible). It would be awesome if the ADSB radar was a &#x27;server&#x27; that could be accessed by IP address through a browser.
 Any ideas, ive seen lots of great posts about ADSB but nothing that fully answered my questions.
 Many thanks!

                    <span>Guru&#x27;s
 As I&#x27;m now well and truly self hosting all of my needs, I find myself wanting to tweak a thing of two from time to time while I&#x27;m in the office.
 I&#x27;m using zerotier where needed so as far as a VPN is concerned I&#x27;m not going to stand up WireGuard or anything else.
 I&#x27;d like to host a browser without needing to install a fully fledged OS like windows or Ubuntu desktop just so I can use Chrome.
 Is there any way to host a chrome, or other, browser ?
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to use my proxmox server to spin up a container that will host a web based browser.
 Suggestions?

                    <span>I am running multiple docker containers, for example nextcloud, monica, heimdall etc. So far they have all been running using http. I am now looking to use only https for all services. Everything is running on a private network and I use a VPN to connect from the outside. Therefore only private IPs are involved. For example to get to nextcloud I do:
 192.168.10.5:100
 for monica I use:
 192.168.10.5:105
 For heimdall I use
 192.168.10.5:80
 etc. same private IP, different port.
 ​
 I therefore need to use reverse proxy for all theses ports and use self signed certificates to get SSL. I am not interested in using letsencrypt, some DNS redirect etc. I want my setup as it is now but with HTTPS. So far when using nginx proxy manager I can get it to work on one service at a time, on port 80 only. I want to use it to listen to multiple different ports. I assume it is because it only listens on port 80 and 443. I have also tried using nextcloud.192.168.10.5 but that is not recognized as the same IP and therefore does not work. How to I use multiple ports with nginx proxy manager? I am using docker for everything

                    <span>Hey,
 I don&#x27;t know if this is the right place to ask this question but here goes: I&#x27;m trying to install a Wordpress site on a vps (I&#x27;ve tried both Ubuntu 20.04 and Debian 10..all with the same issue) using the Wordops installation script and when I get to the point of installing the site ssl (which is done via Letsencrypt) I keep getting the error: 
 Your domain is properly configured but acme.sh was unable to issue certificate. You can find more informations in /var/log/wo/wordops.log 
 ​
 When I check the logs, I get something along the lines of: 
 [[91mIssuing SSL cert with acme.sh[[0m [[91mYour domain is properly configured but acme.sh was unable to issue certificat&gt;
 What am I missing?

                    <span>Hi,
 So I have this compose file which is composed by a VPN container which other containers use its network:
 https://pastebin.com/DQRniwfB
 ​
 This has been working fine, and for radarr, I was able to access via :7878.
 However, now it seems like it is not forwading the 7878 from privoxyvpn to the host. nmap does not show this port.
 Nonetheless, I can &#x60;curl localhost:8989&#x60; from the host, and it reaches radarr. 
 Any thoughts why this suddenly stopped working?
 I have ruled out a firewall issue since other ports work. Only the ones that go through privoxyvpn don&#x27;t
 Thanks

                    <span>Hello, dumb question probably but I&#x27;m not well educated on this topic. I&#x27;m running debian on a laptop as a server for my things, but I don&#x27;t have enough storage for my media. I&#x27;m thinking of either using several external hdd&#x27;s connected by usb or getting a cheap NAS. I&#x27;m thinking about buying &quot;My Cloud Ex2 Ultra&quot; with 2x4TB HDDs for 200eur. The stuff I&#x27;d be storing there wouldn&#x27;t be critical and if it dies it would only inconvenience me. I&#x27;d like for my plex that&#x27;s running on the laptop to be able to stream files off the nas. I know its shit NAS but it basicly costs same as bare HHDs and since I&#x27;m not gonna run any applications on it, I don&#x27;t really care that its shit, right? Or should I just buy once and cry once and get something good?

 I am planning to build a home server mainly for my development activities (mostly backend server-side) and also in parallel want to explore the media server setups. I am very comfortable setting up machines from the scratch and learning new stuff. I am trying to put together a workstation/server machine that can help me with this hobby . I plan to run plenty of docker containers in this machine (30+) and the following is a small list of containers in my mind
 ​
  
Frontends: Traefik, Portainer, Organizr, Heimdall
 Smart Home: HA-Dockermon, Mosquitto MQTT Broker, ZoneMinder, MiFlora Plant Sensors
 Databases: MariaDB, phpMyAdmin, InfluxDB, Postgres, Grafana
 Downloaders: downloader, Transmission Bittorrent with VPN, SABnzbd, qBittorrent with VPN
 Indexers: NZBHydra2, Jackett
 PVRs: …</span>

 Requirements: - supports several third-party emails - strong full-text search - clean but functional UI - also get the calendar and contacts data if possible
 What do you recommend?

                    <span>Hi!
 So I am looking for a solid software for a non profit organization. This is what I need the software to be able to do:
  
Store membership details: name of member, chapter name, chapter location.
 Able to filter search results by chapter name, or city.
 Good organization of data, for example each city contains several chapters, each chapter contains several members. So city --&gt; chapters within that city --&gt; members within that chapter.
 Keep track of membership, no need to be able to process payment, but reminders or indicators preferred for membership fees every 1 year.
 Clear, simple and effective interface - we work with a lot of visually impaired people, so looking for someone that they would be able to use as well.
  
Some additional notes:
  
No need for website. This software is only going to be used by the admin team.
 Since it&#x27;s a non profit organization, would love for the price to be reasonable. Not quite sure what the budget would be but will be happy with a reasonable price if the piece of software is good.
 The way I am kind of thinking about it is Microsoft Access, but more straightforward, modern and preferably on the cloud.
  
I would be happy to provide any more details or answer any questions. Thank you so much in advance for helping me out!

                    <span>Hi,
 ​
 I am running a bunch of containers on docker on my synology nas and two containers in particular and a few others are for network monitoring tools. In this scenario i am using wireshark and ntopng. When running the containers they are showing 172.17.0.1 as local. On this nas i have one router on lan 1 and another (Vpn) router on lan 2. How can i make it show it says lan 1 and it&#x27;s devices (192.168.0.1) and lan 2 and it&#x27;s devices (192.168.1.1) I suspect i will have an issue when i setup grafana and all that stuff. Would this have to be a macvlan? I access all my docker container&#x27;s via my nas ip which follows lan 1 - 192.168.0.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

                    <span>One of the major things that stops me from starting to self-host things like my Google Photos and Cloud is the back-up issue. Third-party do this automatically, with me not having to anything about it ever.
 How do you handle your back-ups?
 Are there any backup solutions when self-hosting that you can just set up once and never have to worry about again (as long as nothing breaks, at least)?
 With the same &quot;safety&quot; as when using a subscription service, so the backups are not just on a separate drive in the same computer but at a completely different location.

                    <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m new to all of this and the definitions of words and concepts are overwhelming. So when I googled &quot;on-premises&quot; sometimes it&#x27;s required to have your server in your home/organisation but sometimes it&#x27;s still&quot; on-prem&quot; if you rent a server as long as you&#x27;re the one in charge over the software and the provider does not give you software and server as a whole.
 So if renting a server is allowed and running your bought software on it, isn&#x27;t that IaaS? And if it really is IaaS, it would make no sense to say &quot;on-premises vs. cloud&quot; because IaaS is also a part of Cloud Computing. It seems to me that often cloud and SaaS are used synonymous.
 In addition, sometimes I read &quot;on-premises software (self-hosting)&quot; as it was the same. But for me, having your own server (rented or bought) is somewhat your &quot;own cloud&quot; at home. And that would contratdict the whole &quot;on-premise vs. cloud&quot; thing. But maybe this is a false understanding of the concept and for the last point, I see why &quot;own cloud at home&quot; is more a metaphor when acknowledging that Cloud Computing is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS and it&#x27;s somehow weird to offer a service to oneself :-) 
 Thanks for reading

                    <span>Hello folks, I am looking for simple program that relays all local SMTP mails to other services (think telegram and curl http post). I did some research and seems like all such programs are quite bulky or no longer maintained.
 Aprise is quite good for hooking multiple services but it doesn&#x27;t have SMTP relay.

                    <span>I have a windows PC with SoftEther VPN. I also have a VPS. How exactly would I turn the VPS in to a VPN so all the windows traffic is tunneled through it? This would result in my Windows PC having the IP address of the VPS.
 Note: I currently &quot;rent&quot; a dedicated IP from a third party service and use SoftEther to tunnel all the traffic through it. However I would like to learn to do this myself and have control over everything.

                    <span>What tools does one need to self host a website server anonymously on the tor network while simultaneously avoiding attackers taking the site down? (Edit) Since ppl are asking about the type of attackers, look at it like this, government agencies are trying to take a site down or locate the owner in this case how would one best protect themselves. Isn&#x27;t it a bit of a chicken and egg problem. As sites get taken down the project is forked elsewhere. At core what I&#x27;m asking is if rather than creating multiple proxies and making the system difficult to penetrate creating multiple forks of the site all hosted in different locations is the best choice??

                    <span>On my Debian Linux Server i am running multiple Docker Compose Container, including Nextcloud and Git. I want to be able to send emails from the containers, for resetting a password for example or git request notifications. How can i make my docker containers able to send mails?
 Right now the server itself is able to send mails via mail command and postfix server, but if i understand correctly that does not make my containers able to send mails. I would need a mail server in every docker container seperately. I would highly appreciate a solution which i can integrate in my docker-compose setup.

                    <span>Following my previous post, I managed to get Wireguard going (with the linuxserver.io docker image) connecting (for now) between my PC and my server. So far so good!
 The problem I have right now is that I&#x27;d like to reach the server (or any other peer) by its name instead of using its internal IP address, while keeping internet access in my client computer that&#x27;s connected to the wireguard server (i.e. I&#x27;ve removed the DNS entry in the client config, otherwise no internet).
 This is my docker-compose.yml file:

                    <span>Hi, I need help to configure my DNS on my domain.
 The situation:I have a domain and I created a DDNS entry, I used ddclient and everything is works fine now with the IP update and everything. However, I host 2 servers on my machine, until recently I had 2 different DDNS to the same IP and then an SRV Record that pointed to them for the servers to work.
 I want however to use only one DDNS IP and somehow use SRV records to point all my servers to that one. I however have little experience with all of that so I don&#x27;t really understand how I am supposed to continue.
 Simply put, I have currently:
 cs.domain.com which points to my ipmc.domain.com which points to my IP again, andip.domain.com which again points to the same IP.
 my ddclient updates ip.domain.com regularly, but not the other two.
 my SRV records point one to the cs (cs._udp.domain.com) and one to the mc DDNS entries (mc._tcp.domain.com). I can easily fix the issue by just updating all 3 DDNS Entries, but I feel like there should be an easier solution.
 For further questions feel free to ask me, and thanks in advance.

                    <span>I am trying to find a good modern book keeping / accounting solution for a UK based software startup.
 Basically, until now most of my accounting was running in spreadsheets, but I am seeking more automation, but ideally also want to be able to plug into HMRC (my company is all remote, but since you need to put a pin on a map somewhere, for us that is London). It should fulfil all requirements and I want to be able to have control over the data, but it should also be sitting on a modern platform, so I won&#x27;t have to move everything again soon.Whilst access to compute resources won&#x27;t be an issue (we&#x27;re a software company), ease of use is: Right now we don&#x27;t have any admin staff (yet). Where do I best start? Would invoice ninja be suitable or am I running into the wrong direction looking at that?
 I appreciate pointers that might help me or questions I should be asking.

                    <span>I want to setup a new homelab, but I want to refrain from spending where I dont have to and keeping noise low since I have a rack in my studio. I also currently have a RPI 3b+ and 2b+ that arent doing anything if I could use those.
  
Software plans:
  
Backups/file sharing (NFS?)
 Calendar/Contacts (Nextcloud?)
 Mail server (Dovecot?)
 Photo gallery (Photoprism?)
 VPN (Wireguard)
 Tor router
 XMPP server (ejabberd or snikket?)
 Notes/Knowledge manager (Currently use obsidian locally)
  
 Im also looking on craigslist and there are some servers for ~$100 but im worried about noise:
  
Dell PowerEdge 1950 III
 Dell PowerEdge R210 1U
 HP Proliant DL380 Gen4
 SuperServer 6013E-i
 SuperMicro X Series
 Dell PowerEdge 2650

 I can get this using this plugin:
 https://github.com/texxasrulez/additional_imap
 And did some ajusts:
 ​
  
Delete all custom config from gmail and gmx(or other if you use it) of /plugins/additional_imap/config.inc.php
 
Enabled &quot;Show real names for special folders&quot; in Settings-&gt;preferences-&gt;Special Folders
 
Add rc3k_ prefix to plugin tables on DB.
 
 ​
 To be a perfect solution, only miss one little thing:
 ​
 ALL INBOXES Option
 ​
 There is no multi-accs-webmail-imap-reader with a nice interface available for free/selfhosted, this roundcube+additional_imap its the closest solution that i can found.
 Im a happy user of SparkMail, but they dont have a web/win version.
 Nextcloud Mail app do the job, but is too slow and buggy...
 ​
 If you know a better solution, please send it here! Thanks

                    <span>Hi All,
 After many many years of ignoring reverse proxy, I sat down today to finally set one up. I have spent the morning looking over many videos and different ways of doing it, but it seems that most of them want you to have your sites remotely accessible. In my case, I want a simple method of accessing all my services without remembering what ports and addressing they would be on. I know that MDNS does a lot of it. But it&#x27;s no good for nested services with ports. I&#x27;ve started to dive into the SWAG documentation. I&#x27;m not sure if ngix manager or swag would be a better fit. My google-fu has failed me, or maybe I&#x27;m being impatient to find the right tutorial. 
 I&#x27;m looking to pull off, something as easy as:
 homeassistant.local
 sab.local
 smokeping.localdomain. 
 octoprint
 unfi.localdomain
 omv.localdomain 
 portianer.local
 ​
 then I want to configure some sort of easy home page like homer that my wife and I can easily find. Can anyone point me to a video or blog that would be able to guide me through?

 I have scripts from GitHub, but those scripts don&#x27;t have a subscribe function, log, and timing for the last 24 hours. 
 Maybe anybody has some ideas on how to create something like this for my few blogs for a reasonable price or with some free stuff? Thank you!

                    <span>Hey folks,
 Following up on a previous post. Thanks for the kind and constructive feedback! We have considered the most requested features and crafted a Public Roadmap. 
 Check it out here https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee/projects/2 and please let us know what you think.
 We are behind in features comparing to Tailscale or Zerotier, but I believe we are on the right path to cover most of them. Our main goal is a fully open-source system so that it can be r/selfhosted without any hidden parts.
 Shortly on main points from the roadmap:
 - Peer management with a UI dashboard so that you don&#x27;t need to add peers manually
 - Automatic network changes provisioning so that every peer in the system has the latest state (and newly added peers)
 - Windows support
 - ACLs
 - Mobile clients
 We are a team of two and are looking for some help :). Feel free to reach out if you are willing to contribute.
 Cheers,

                    <span>What I have:
  
a server w/ 4c CPU and 32GB RAM
 2TB ZFS Pool (originally made by FreeNAS &amp; Full of Data)
  
What I want:
  
preferably FOSS
 Web Interface
 Creation/editing/deletion of VMs
 Management for Docker (haven&#x27;t dabbled in docker yet, but definitely want to)
 Ability to adopt existing ZFS-Pool
 Ability to mount directories on said ZFS pool to VM&#x27;s directly (e.g. mount &quot;/mnt/ZFS/music&quot; on the host to &quot;/music&quot; on the VM without a network connecting host and VM)
 Ability to assign different VMs to different VLANs (on the host network)
 SMB File sharing
 maybe some load-balancing in the future (not required)
  
What I want this for:
  
local network file server (smb)
 reverse proxy (nginx)
 website host (nginx)
 mediaserver (don&#x27;t know yet)
 VPN-Server (openvpn)
 Matrix Homeserver (don&#x27;t know yet)
  
Does anyone know an OS that would check these boxes?
 I am asking because my FreeNAS boot stick died, and now that I have to redo it anyway, I&#x27;m wondering whether there is a better way to do this. (I am going to use a 128GB SSD for the next install to not repeat this error.)
 I have tried Proxmox as well, and it does a lot of these things right, but I cannot find a (GUI) way to do the mounting I described above, also doing all the ZFS and SMB configuration in the terminal only sounds like a recipe for a security disaster if I am the person configuring it, even though it works.

                    <span>The other day I was wondering why my raspberry pi was slow, and I found out that one process had been using 100% of the CPU for a few hours, for no reason.
 I&#x27;m already using netdata to monitor the system, but I&#x27;d like to find some software that could detect this sort of anomalies and alert me (ideally via Telegram since I already use that for other notifications). I don&#x27;t need anything too fancy, I&#x27;d like to keep it simple.
 Any ideas ?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a RPi with a few dev services running (Gogs, DroneCI, Nextcloud,...) and I thought, this might be a pretty common setup, but I could not find any pre-existing Docker-Compose/Helm/Ansible/whatever scripts.
 Would any of you be interested in such a thing? Nothing super fancy, just a simple configurable template. And if yes, what would you prefer? Helm? Compose? Bare metal? What services are important to you?
 Oh, and if this already exists, please let me know, I don&#x27;t want to duplicate work.

                    <span>So I am a developer who has a vps for some basic stuff, but I guess this is not that important for this question. Scrolling through this sub I see some awesome things that would make life a lot easier, however I can&#x27;t find a lot about the setup people use (config wise, not hardware). This sub has some awesome posts like what people use, what they&#x27;ve learned, how they failed, etc, but I&#x27;m more curious to how you&#x27;ve setup your server and what you like / dislike about the setup.
 For example, I&#x27;m planning to start self hosting and redo my vps setup in the following way:
 Ubuntu with docker, openssh, ufw and fail2ban, as I&#x27;m already familiar with this and it keeps it easy to what I&#x27;ve installed directly on Ubuntu itself. Then use Portainer with nginx reverse proxy to setup all the various services like NextCloud, wiki, etc. Probably setup 2 database instances (prod/dev) in case something breaks and so I can start fixing it without hurting production. Lastly, add something to back up the docker containers and config to an external party, just don&#x27;t know which one yet. 
 What I like so far: - Little directly installed on Ubuntu itself so updates are easy and I can quickly see if the problem is with docker, the service or Ubuntu - Server wise it&#x27;s a bit easier to make it secure with only a few things running on Ubuntu itself - Docker itself, just nice to have everything running in containers
 What I don&#x27;t like / not sure of: - Pure my config, but current setup has 1 DB for all services - I&#x27;ve heard that securing and updating docker containers are an absolute nightmare (I&#x27;m pretty new to docker so not sure) - Everything is running on docker, so if docker fails all fails - For all new services I&#x27;ll use I have to export and import the config in the dev database (or the other way around)
 So how did you guys set up your server and what do you like and dislike about it? Maybe share your experiences so far with different setups so new (rookie) members can learn :)

                    <span>I run my homelab on a Proxmox machine. I have several LXC containers and a couple virtual machines, each running a single service. So far, everything is attached to the same bridge vmbr0, which is attached to the physical network card. Since I am getting a new drive, I wanted to reinstall my homelab and restructure its network, putting each service (or group of services) in its own network, so that they are properly isolated from each other and communication between them can be regulated by the firewall.
 The standard approach seems to be to make a series of bridges vmbrX, one for each network, and to create a virtual machine running pfSense or OPNSense managing such bridges, handling all the routing between them and vmbr0. I was wondering, however, if there is a way to do this without the additional virtual machine. Could Proxmox itself handle the routing in place of OPNSense? There are firewall settings, and there are multiple network settings (vlan, bridges, bonds), but I am not too familiar with the topic.
 Is there any good example of this setup, or do you have any advice?
 Notes:
  
 I do not want to use NAT. Ideally, I want my local network to be something like 172.16.0.0 and each service to be on something like 172.16.X.0, where the entire subnet can be reached from my local network (barring firewall, of course).

                    <span>Hey guys!
 ​
 I want to self host a watch together service so my friends and I can watch stuff off my home server. It would need to support basically mkv and mp4 video files, and I&#x27;d be okay with being the only one who has control over playback. 
 Basically, I just need to have a video stream to a webpage so my friends and I can watch it together. I have my own domain, so I just need the service.
 ​
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: I am running emby, so by the looks of things I may need to run a second media server side by side, or switch entirely. Any other suggestions are much appreciated though!

                    <span>Is this possible to do? I have two domains, one short, one long. I&#x27;d like to use the short domain as a shortcut to redirect to the long domain, but with a bulk approach. I know I can setup subdomains for each and redirect to an individual subdomain, but is it possible to redirect it as a wildcard and pass along the subdomain to the longer domain?

                    <span>Good Afternoon Everyone!
 I for some odd reason have been working on trying to get my HP Proliant DL180 G6 up with Windows Server 2019 with a mutual Raid 50 Drives. Its a 12 bay slot but I&#x27;m only using 7 currently. I have succesfully update and installed Windows Server 2019. I am having 2 issues. I have successfully installed Raid 50 and the install drive is a 500gb Drive seperate from the Raid 50.
 The first issue is setting up the Raid 50 for the VM and sharing it as an internal Drive. I dont care if its not C:\ but i need it to have a drive letter. I got the Raid 50 to show up once as Drive D:\ but it went away after a couple of minutes. Now it wont allow me to connect the Windows Server 2019 to Windows 10 VM through the ISCSI Initator. Ive tried to initialize the ISCSI device that was created in Server Management ----&gt; Files and Storage Server -------&gt; ISCSI
 But it always says cannot connected PC on both Windows Server 2019 and the Windows 10 Hyper-V VM.
 ​
 Ive also tried a share drive and an ISCSI and a server pool both fixed and dynamic. Ive tried rebootingt he VM and the HP Proliant DL180 G6
 I&#x27;ve copied the IQN, IP Adress from the Host Server 2019 Computer to Windows 10 VM and vice versa in ISCSI Initiator and i always get cannot connect to PC on both. Ive also tried to find a target and it wont allow me to add it. I have no idea what to do now. The storage pool is empty and i would prefer a fixed volume for faster transfer rates. I cant find the answer anywhere. Thank you ahead of time for all comments.

 2ND Issue:
 I Have a Nvidia Server graphics card. It doesn need a 6pin i have already installed the 16x rise. But Windows cant recognize the card can anyone help!

                    <span>Hello,
 Backstory:
 I used to use a Hetzner CX11 VPS for my Selfhosted apps. However, I wanted more storage and control. So, I brought myself a Raspberry Pi 4gb planning to use Cloudflare Tunnel to access my Raspberry Pi without opening ports on the house Router. However, I encountered problems with Cloudflare Tunnel, see below. 
 The main services that I host are:
 · Nextcloud
 · PiGallery2
 · Vaultwarden / BitwardenRs
 · Heimdall Dashboard
 I do have admin access to the house Router however I am going off to University in September and plan on taking my Raspberry Pi with me where I will not be able to open ports on the router. 
 Services I have tried:

                    <span>I see managed services costly for small projects but they have thier advantages regarding stability.
 Any measures we can take for making sure we get nearly same stability as managed databases?
 For ex: What reliable affordable hosting services exist to host the databases? What databases are light weight and recover even after a crash quickly?

                    <span>Guru&#x27;s
 As my Synology just passed away, I am in need of a file sync utility that I can install on my wife and son&#x27;s windows installs to sync a directory back to the fileserver on the LAN.
 Because of this reason....
  
it needs to be free and open source
 
It needs to silently sync without user intervention
 
It needs to sync when files are added not at a predetermined schedule
 
 I used to use Synology Drive and it worked well.
 What do you gents use?
 I&#x27;ve heard some bad things about duplicati so would probably want to stay clear of it.
 Also, I&#x27;d like to not have to install a utility on my server for the sync to be possible, e.g. syncthing
 (I&#x27;m using rclone on an Ubuntu container to keep Google drive in sync with a few local directories, very happy)

                    <span>I forgot the &quot;?&quot; smh.
 I am planning to use an old laptop of mine which is gathering dust in a shelf to use it as a small server for my data. 
 Having a hard time on which tool should I use to make my own small in-home cloud and host it in that machine: whether it id Nextcloud/Owncloud or Syncthing.
 What I want is to be able to access my files from all my devices and, of course, having remote access to them (when I&#x27;m not at home). 
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>I have a dedicated home machine running unRaid and using borg to backup to an external hard drive as well as to 2 remote providers, 1 is just unRaid, other is unRaid and important stuff.
 I have a VPS that I use to host websites and other various services. It has backups provided by the hosting provider, as well as backup via borg to a remote service.
 What I want to do is also store a backup from the VPS to my home server, preferably via borg. I would prefer my home server to make the connection to my VPS, via ssh, and then do the backup of what I need.
 Anyone have a suggestion on best way to do this?
 Could I do a borg backup on my VPS, then rsync the borg save location to my home server?
 I am sure there is a better way to do it, just not seeing it.

                    <span>Preferably something easy to setup that works on windows. I have a 6700k dedicated server that I use for other things that has 1000 up/down. I&#x27;d like to stream to it at around 25k~ bitrate from my own computer using a program like OBS. Preferably at 144fps+. I&#x27;ve tried using plex/jellyfin as a media server instead and using syncplay, but those were both terrible experiences.
 Any help here?

                    <span>I run an unraid server with multiple docker containers. Rather than individual credentials for each app, I&#x27;ve started learning about Authelia and have successfully set up a simple authentication process for a container. Now that I have this first step working, I&#x27;m a little confused on next steps to deploy it into action:
 For example, say I have a container with paperless. I can protect the web UI for that container with authelia without much trouble, but how do I make paperless aware that I am logged in? Do I disable the paperless login mechanism to it auto logs in a user? (this seems dangerous). Do I use the token option to log in via API?
 Maybe it is different for each container, but a general workflow of how it&#x27;s supposed to work or where I can read some tutorial would be appreciated.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is the correct subreddit for this so if not then I am sorry
 so, I really wanted to and now even more so want to create a home server that I could use to host anything I like/test and etc. I got to a technology school so me and a friend did a project with an old cisco server that we put ESXi on, a switch and other stuff and that made me understand how it all works and pushed me to want to set it up for real this time, I got a switch, ap and all the things needed but the actual server. one person at my school told me how he uses an old laptop with ESXi as a server. so I was wondering what would be a good starting point since I searched a bit and found decommissioned servers for about £100 I think and I don&#x27;t know if that is work or if to just do what that guy did and create a server from a laptop 
 thank you in advance

                    <span>Please let me know if a post like this is not allowed.
 I&#x27;ve been working on my own apps for my home media needs throughout covid. I just released the Server and Music apps and posted about it on /r/musichoarders. Even though this subreddit isn&#x27;t music related, I think the project might be interesting to some of you.
 It&#x27;s called Cardinal, and it&#x27;s an ecosystem of apps for playing your media at home. Right now the Server and Music apps are available for macOS and Windows as early access releases, and soon the mobile Music app will be released. Planned apps are Photos, Books, and TV &amp; Movies, which will all feed from the Server app.
 There&#x27;s also a GitHub for technical info, where lots of the code has been open sourced.
 The apps are free to use and free of all types of advertising, tracking, and marketing. It would be nice to get feedback on whether people are interested in using something like this, because I would love to work on this long term if there&#x27;s enough interest. Any and all feedback is welcome!

                    <span>Hey There, 
 I am building a cocktail bar in my dining room and I am looking to take it a step further buy giving my guests (friends and neighbors) a tablet with a menu of cocktails. Below are a few things I am looking to accomplish. 
  
Keep an inventory of all alcohol / liquor on hand
 Associate cocktails with ingredients and as each ingredient gets used alert me that we are running low based on inventory. 
 Allow guests to start a tab, and email them a receipt of cocktails ordered...this would help them remember what they liked last time they ordered. 
 Front end menu would be a menu with either hand selected cocktails (limit) or all cocktails (based on inventory of ingredients)
  
I am 99% confident that this doesn&#x27;t exist in a self hosted product, but I am ok with hacking something together. Maybe a combination of something like SnipeIT + ? ... I dunno. Any suggestions are welcome!

                    <span>Hey there,
 I need to learn a bit of Docker, Ansible, Hadoop, and MongoDB for a new job I took on recently.
 ​
 Anyone have any idea for anything I could self-host, and tweak a bit to learn the basics of these products?
 ​
 Thanks.

                    <span>There is a learning curve from Docker to Kubernetes, especially when you feel comfortable with one and not the other, this week has been a hard yet fruitful journey into the world of Kubernetes, using everything self-hosted I was able to deploy my own homespun docker image (N8N) from Proget onto Kubernetes and using MetalLb and Traefik access it from my lan.
 Some may say &quot;this is well documented already&quot; and that&#x27;s fine, I personally went down a lot of rabbit holes with incorrect YAML files and commands, so put this together for me to remind me, and it might help someone else.

                    <span>Hey Guys. Love this sub and all the amazing gems you can find on here.
 I wanted to ask if anyone knew of a dashboard that has Google SSO.
 I don&#x27;t need there to be any graphs or anything. Just a simple page with links and icons to all of the resources that we use.
 I&#x27;ve seen Homer but I don&#x27;t think its meant to be used in an organisation and doesn&#x27;t have Google SSO.
 If anyone knows of anything, Please do let me know!

                    <span>Asked this in Proxmox but didnt get any answer, but then may be its not a proxmox solution. Any guidance here please?
 ​
 Setup
 Server A) Proxmox Home server running multiple VMs (jellyfin - its own drive, nextcloud - its own zpool, wordpress and few other dockers in LVM on proxmox)
 Server B) dedicated Ubuntu mining machine that can double as backup server
 ----------------
 Questions
 Q1) I am not sure the right way to back server A. Do I back everything ideally like LVMs + Zpool data all together as one single thing? How does back up works?
 Q2) Technically, PBS could be handy to run on B, but Server B will be running chia/mining stuff on Ubuntu 24x7. I can add few more disks to it and automate backup on it from server A. How to do it?
 Q3) Its not a huge deal for me if I lose proxmox configuration, but definitely want Zpool and Jellyfin and VM (website coding etc) data auto backed up on server B. But then just why not back config anyway if its simple so if I ever drop a hammer on server A by accident, I can get replacement up really quick.
 Q4) What is better raid on Server A since I will have Server B backing up. Do I need to waste a disc on A for redundancy. Server B is already in a different location and will have Server C as cold backup later.

                    <span>I am using Authelia together with Nginx Proxy Manager. Both are installed with Docker containers on the same host. I have got the setup working with most of my services, but for some reason when trying to get it to work with VSCode (using linuxserver/code-server) I only get a white/blank screen after login. I am using the same endpoint configuration for all the services just changing out the address and port number . I have no trouble with VSCode when not behind Authelia. Checking F12 on the page shows a bunch of WebSocets error like this: 
 WebSocket connection to &#x27;wss://vscode.domain.com/?type&#x3D;Management&amp;reconnectionToken&#x3D;d0bb10e8-2249-4f90-9da8-2b4358f90451&amp;reconnection&#x3D;false&amp;skipWebSocketFrames&#x3D;false&#x27; failed: 
 Anyone have any tip as to what might be wrong?

 Can someone help me with the following please. I&#x27;m currently using Gitea and Drone CI (running in Docker on my NAS, so selfhosted!) and I&#x27;m trying to roll out my html code, via a pipeline, to my website. I just have no idea how to make this happen.
 ​
  
Can Drone CI somehow put my html code into a web service image and eventually deploy it to my website?
 Or can I have Drone CI put the code in a certain location on my NAS, so that a docker image that runs, picks it up and shows it on my website?
 or can Drone CI somehow execute a docker-compose.yml file?
  
​
 what is the easiest/fastest thing i can do to get this done?
 ​
 so what Iam trying to achieve:
 html code -&gt; gitea -&gt; trigger -&gt; Drone CI -&gt; puts my code online (somehow)

My goal is to install Snipe-IT and for this I need to make some configurations on the server. But it seems that I am not able to connect to the server machine from the desktop machine. I am fairly new to servers and troubleshooted a lot but editing the sshd_config file didn&#x27;t word. I try using ssh to login into the server with [usernameServer@127.0.0.1](mailto:usernameServer@127.0.0.1) but password authentification returns &quot;permission denied, please try again&quot;. And also using [usernameServer@12.0.2.15](mailto:usernameServer@12.0.2.15) returns the same error. How can I establish a connection between the Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop running on the same local machine?

 Yesterday a HDD died on me and my containers stopped working. I found out about this by a user saying they could not access ownCloud (I missed smartmontools alerting me of issues). So it was high-time that I learnt about the joys of &quot;MTA&quot;. I am writing up what I learnt so hopefully it helps others.

 Nothing is publicly accessible via the Internet (expect for the VPN service). 
 If you want to access something, you need to be on the VPN.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a side project that, according to https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/nwmfvr/how_do_you_manage_your_users_authentication/, the community might find interesting.
 It&#x27;s not yet ready to use (some core features are missing), but the idea is:
 Provide a (restricted) LDAP interface for services to list users and authenticate them, and a friendly web interface to manage the users. It&#x27;s pretty opinionated (all users in the same OU, all groups in the same OU, limited query-only capabilities and so on) but should be sufficient for 90% of LDAP use cases, and has a *much* simpler deployment and management story than any full LDAP-based system.
 It&#x27;s written in Rust to have minimal memory requirements, and the data is stored in SQL for simple backups. It would be absolutely trivial to wrap in a Docker container.
 If you are interested in contributing, check out https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap! Beginners welcome, I have some simple tasks to give if you&#x27;re just starting with Rust.

 So, awhile back I saw on here someone talk about a dashboard that had buttons you could click that would run a command on the server. I remember them saying, it was great for giving some one access to that that you couldn&#x27;t trust with SSH. I happen to need this exact thing (a few days after reading it). 
 Can someone throw me a bone and a link / info on this.
 Dashboard, you click a button and it runs a command on the server. I&#x27;m thinking of using it to kick off docker images that run and do automated tasks such as create PDF reports based on numbers for work related stuffs.

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently self-hosting Gitea for source control, but I was wondering if any of you fine people have set up any self-hosted continuous integration environments. I would obviously prefer ones that work with Gitea.
 It&#x27;s very time-consuming to go through all the items on the &quot;awesome&quot; lists, so I&#x27;m hoping for some educated opinions.
 Edit: I&#x27;m mostly a .NET (core) developer, so anything that can use integrate natively, or at least be able to shoehorn in something with scripts is also a plus.

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>So yeah basically i need a windows VPS that i connect to thru a RDC. 
 Wouldn&#x27;t stream games or anything, but mostly just a blank screen with a few statistics. What specs would you recommend? I tried with VPS 4GB ram and 2 Intel Xeon CPU Cores and it&#x27;s not working well. Tried streaming with OBS and it&#x27;s laggy as hell, stream not even displaying. 
 Any recommendations? What should the minimum specs be? How much bandwith will i use? Any recommended provider?

                    <span>Heyho,
 I am part of a group organizing a project. Most of the people are non-nerds and we need a tool to share information online. Normally Google Docs/Drive would be fine, but for idealistic reasons that is not desired. So I&#x27;m looking for a nice alternative that will allow us to 
 a) share files (PDF, images and so on) online 
 and
 b) be able to edit files via browser and especially
 smartphone, since most people are mobile users. It is enough to be able to edit text files. 
 There is no need for collaborative editing and text files are enough - no odt, no doc, plain text is fine.
 But it needs to be simple and it would be nice if it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of additional apps on the phone.
 I skimmed the awesome selfhosted list, so far my best option would be Nextcloud and OnlyOffice pointing to the Nextcloud instance.
 Any better ideas out there? 
 Really perfect would be something like Mattermost, but with text editing (like an included Etherpad/Cryptpad feature). There is a Collabora plugin for Mattermost, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work on mobile/via the Mattermost app.

                    <span>Hi! I hope you won&#x27;t laugh at me for this question because I&#x27;m a total noob at self-hosting and this will be my first try.
 I created an account on Hetzner and want to self-host these apps (I included what I use right now in brackets):
  
Ghost or Wordpress (using static site with 11ty - free)
 Linkding (using raindrop - free)
 Wallabag (using pocket - $2.73/year)
 MiniFlux (using miniflux hosting - $15/year)
 Nextcloud (using Google One - $6.88/year)
 Standard Notes (using InkDrop - free with dev license)
 Plausible (using goatcounter - free)
  
Because 1 Euro is equal to 10.26 Turkish Lira, I want to self-host these in smallest €2.49 CX11 server with these specs:
  
1 Intel vCPU
 2 GB Ram
 20 GB Disk Space
 20 TB Traffic
  
I won&#x27;t use these apps regularly, I&#x27;ll use them rarely. It will be mostly for learning purpose. I might even move to my current stack.
 So is this server specs enough for this purpose, if not what will be?

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a simple solution to being behind a CG-NAT. Check the tldr; at the end
 ​
 I&#x27;ve learned a lot about self hosting in the last weeks, after a colleague told me about nextcloud.
 I bought a fully upgraded mac mini 2012, installed Virtualbox, created an ubuntuVM and set up docker + compose. I installed nextcloud and started experimenting with it.
 I got rid of my fiber internet access a few years ago because my mobile phone provider offers an additional data sim card for about $5/mo and my traffic is unlimited.
 But that plan isn&#x27;t great: I&#x27;m behind CG-NAT (Carrier-grade NAT) which means there&#x27;s no way for me to reach my server when I&#x27;m not on the home wifi because my public IP address is shared between several other customers.
 So I called them to enquire about public ipv4 addresses op…</span>

                    <span>I need recommendations for file sync software. This is a long post and I have specific needs, and have also tried several popular file-syncing tools already, so please read the whole thing before commenting.
 My setup is as follows:
  
Desktop with 4 TB HDD space, running Manjaro
 
Laptop with 250 GB SSD space, running Manjaro
 
Phone with ??? limited space, Android
 
Headless mini PC in a cupboard, connected to a 6 TB external HDD, intended as always-on server, running Ubuntu
  
What I want to accomplish:
 I want to be able to synchronize folders within my home folder between my laptop and desktop. This needs to work so that I have local copies of the files, and I&#x27;m not always waiting on network latency to do things.

                    <span>Just discovered this place and would like to introduce you to our open source routing engine:
 https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper#readme
 GraphHopper offers you the path finding functionality (&quot;A to B routing&quot;) that you probably know from Google Maps and uses data from the incredible OpenStreetMap project (see also /r/openstreetmap).
 To fully self-host a route planner (e.g. a &quot;Google Maps&quot; equivalent) you need GraphHopper for the routing and two other parts: you also need some visualization aka &quot;maps&quot; (e.g. with OpenMapTiles) and you need the address search (e.g. with Photon).
 We have a hosted version of this and you can try it: GraphHopper Maps. It is also privacy friendly without any trackers.
 This web app is not (yet) as polished as Google Maps app but there are many projects that use the routing functionality of GraphHopper and offer &quot;complete&quot; apps like outdoor apps (komoot, trailrouter, ride with GPS, Locus Map, plotaroute, Kurviger) or other services (delivery hero, deutsche bahn, GLS, ...)
 And GraphHopper can be used for more things beyond routing like for reachability analysis:
 Reachability analysis across an entire country
 Make sure you follow our twitter or blog posts. For example we recently released version 3.0.

                    <span>Hello everyboy,
 I am looking for a self hosted project management software to use for a non-profit hospital. It should support Kanban boards and maybe even some Scrum, Burndown- &amp; Gantt Charts.
 What I tried:
 - JIRA Software: Got a free community license but the terminology is too software focused
 - JIRA Core: Neutral terminology but no Kanban boards
 - Taiga.io: Looks awesome and our first test server was set up quickly but horrible to set up for configuration with HTTPS and so on. We can&#x27;t get the mail settings or the LDAP sync to work and the documentation is clearly from coders for coders (a lot of knowledge is assumed).

                    <span>For those of you who have a self-hosted server with several users (e.g. family) and several services (e.g. Nextcloud, Airsonic, Jellyfin, ...), how do you manage authentication and various passwords?
 The canonical solution that seems to be supported by pretty much everyone is to have an LDAP server (OpenLDAP) and plugin everything to that server (Nextcloud users, Authelia for SSO/resource gating, Keycloak if you&#x27;re feeling fancy and so on).
 That still leaves some services (e.g. Plex) with their own proprietary accounts (can&#x27;t really work around that).
 Unfortunately, setting up and managing OpenLDAP is a pain, and it does way more than necessary.
 What are your solutions to that?

                    <span>I recently got myself a Synology NAS and got into selfhosting. So im relatively new to all of this and making use of guides to get it working.
 One of the things I wanted to selfhost was a RSS feed which I found in FreshRSS. So I searched online for a guide on how to install this on my NAS and found this guide: https://mariushosting.com/how-to-install-freshrss-on-your-synology-nas/
 This guide explains really well how to install FreshRSS into docker but it ends there.
 So far so good followed the guide and got everything to work, installed the FeedMe app on my android phone and got my own RSS feed. Only to find out that it does not automatically refresh my feed. I have to push the actualize button myself everytime which is obviously not what I want to do. Ideally I want it to automatically refresh every X minutes.
 So the beginner I am tried searching for solutions, which I found but got none to work. On the FreshRSS website it self it states I have to do something with the ./app/actualize_script.php but the fun thing is with the guide I used mentioned above I got none of those things. Don&#x27;t have the app folder nor have I the script they are talking about. The only folders I have are crontabs, keys, log, nginx, php and www. And inside those folders there is also nothing to find they are talking about.
 So for a summary I have FreshRSS running atm in a docker container on my Synology NAS which is working but only need a solution for how to automatically refresh my feed every X minutes or so.
 Does some of you have experience with this and can help a starting self hoster out?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: Not Refresh but FreshRSS thanks!

However, I can&#x27;t seem to upload videos (tried different formats/codecs) and I don&#x27;t know how to pin websites. It seems to only do images or gifs. Am I doing something wrong? Are these features not implemented yet?
 If those are Pinry limitations, what do you fellow self-hosters use that handles at least videos? TBH, I don&#x27;t really care about websites, but it would be a nice addition.

 The key tasks that i am looking for are: -tenant management -tracking renovations and upgrades -availability to add notes (maybe also upload files) to any object
 Not necessary but are welcome -Billing Management -integrated mail and calendar viewer
 The software should be selfhostable and preferably open source. 
 Thanks ahead guy’s for your recommendations. I hope it it’s going to get rid of some stacks of post-it‘s and excel spreadsheets.

                    <span>Looking for something simple I can record what pills I’ve taken, when, and maybe set reminders for when to take the next lot?
 Bonus if it has a mobile app, but not required.

                    <span>I&#x27;m finally thinking to replace Google Photos with a self-hosted alternative... I&#x27;ve tried Piwigo but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for and I gave up, but now I&#x27;ve seen that both Photoprism and Librephotos (which is also available on Yunohost, cool) could fit my needs. Do you use one of them? Which one? And why?

                    <span>I guess this is as good a place as any to share my automated Docker Swarm deployment.
 This makes it easy to deploy a web server, complete with Traefik, Portainer and Docker Swarm. Add you own stacks, or deploy mine using the included instructions.
 I am adding stacks slowly. Currently available are IgnitionSCADA and ERPNext stacks, I mean...I have heaps, but they need to be tidied up for public consumption aha.
 Happy to answer questions.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to install Guacamole or even trasa inside a docker container on a publicly accessible VPS. 
 From that publicly accessible VPS, I want to be able to RDP into a home computer behind a NAT. 
 The solution normally would be to use some sort of VPN (OpenVPN, WireGuard, ZeroTier, etc) to connect the VPS host to the home network. 
 How is it done from inside a docker container to a home network?

                    <span>Hello there. I am relatively new to the home server scene, but I&#x27;ve quickly begun hosting several services on mine. A personal website via nginx, Pi Hole, Home Assistant, Vaultwarden, etc. - all of these have helpful web interfaces that want to display on ports 80/443 by default. I&#x27;ve been skittish on setting some of these up, for fear of disrupting what I already have working, and I&#x27;m curious about what people recommend as the best solution. There are some solutions I&#x27;ve been investigating - having each service use its own arbitrary port, or I think it&#x27;s possible to manage everything via nginx (I see the word &#x27;reverse proxy&#x27; thrown around, but I have no idea if the nginx settings I&#x27;ve been fiddling with is that). I would like to see what people here suggest. Thanks.

                    <span>Does that make your eye twitch a little bit? Like… it’s a typo. It should be target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot; with an underscore to start the value. As in…
&lt;a target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;https://codepen.io&quot;Open CodePen in a New Tab
&lt;/a
Welp, that’s correct syntax!…

                    <span>The idea of collecting information about the flights I have taken in the past, the airlines I fly on and the airports I visit had always appealed me.
 I never got to the point of noting all these details down with pen and paper, as some friends of mine were doing for years, however, I was keen to find a web or app-based solution that came also with all the bells and whistles in terms of data visualization, maps, and the like.
 I found out about FlightMemory, but, as you will understand, I was not exactly thrilled by its looks. A good one I have been using is myFlightradar24, particularly when it comes to its map view, however, I was looking to see if there was a self-hosted one or even a excel template to get the options to play with your flight data and perhaps customise the periods of time you wish to look at and create infographics.

Vuepress seems really complicated for my usage.I am currently using wiki.js but I am not quite happy with it. To make the navigation easy it&#x27;s to hard at my eyes for the users. Grav on the other side looks also quite complicated...
 I really need a simple wiki structure but with a smooth design do you guys know any other Wiki/Docs software I could use?

                    <span>The hosts always talk about shucking drives from external hard drive enclosures to save money- because for some reason hard drives in these USB enclosures can be cheaper than just buying a hard drive.
 Ok... Where are people getting these things for the right price point? It would be nice to catch a good deal and I don&#x27;t really pay attention to computer prices until I need something.
 Say, 10+ TB non-SMR drives for a NAS. What would you say is your steal price

                    <span>I am currently using a 3rd party service to schedule my (MySQL) database backups, it runs a mysqldump at a specified interval and stores the copy on a remote storage service (eg. Backblaze B2).
 I am looking to replace this service with a self-hosted solution/script, it should do the following:
  
Be able to run a db export command (eg. mysqldump) at a specified time interval, probably using a cron job
 Upload the local backup to a remote storage (AWS, B2, etc.)
 Send alerts/notifications if a backup fails
  
My initial idea was to create a script that does all the above things, and simply run that script as a cron job on the server of the database itself. I know this is not ideal, as if that server goes down the fail notifications won&#x27;t work anymore. To solve this, maybe just use a separate server to log the backup successes, and that server could handle notifications if a success wasn&#x27;t received in a specified amount of time.
 ​
 Do you know of any self-hosted apps/scripts that do this? If not, I will try writing one myself as the implementation should be pretty easy.

 I am wondering if you all can help me out with setting up my Nextcloud instance how I would like. I have a local Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu Server 21.04. I have configured the docker-compose using a Fedora 34 Linux computer on the local network.
 I followed the extremely helpful guide from smarthomebeginner (Docker Traefik2 guide, then the Nextcloud guide). I can connect to my NC instance using nextclolud.MYDOMAIN.com and it works perfectly! However, when I am on my local network, I would like to be able connect to my Nextcloud locally. When I used NextCloudPi I could connect using the IP of my RPi and the port. I would love to have this functionality back for when I am on my home network for when I upload all of my photos for the first time (approximately 20 GB). However, …</span>

 As the title says, I currently have a Node 804 case currently hosting a Ryzen 3600, ASRock AM4/X570M, 4 8TB SATA hard drives and a 1660 super for all of my transcoding needs.
 I&#x27;d like to replace this case with something that can be rack mounted, I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about server cases so I thought I&#x27;d ask those more knowledgeable.
 Ideally I&#x27;d like to have quite a few more drives in the case whilst still having support and enough room for the GPU. Is a SAS/SATA backplane possible? Can anyone think of a case that might work?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi everybody,
 just evaluating a start page.
 Here https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#personal-dashboards I&#x27;ve seen there is a collection of tools for doing this, can you tell me your experiences with them and which satisfy better my requirements without have to test all of them :)?
 I&#x27;m interested in the following aspects:
  
easy to install: docker, pulling a single image of course is better of a docker compose file
 easy to config: I prefer no config file but a user interface with Add botton for services and group of services
 lightweight
 stable, well maintained
 responsive
 user interface: icon + text for each service; the page should be &quot;dense&quot; of contents, to see at glance a lot of services ( I mean, no too wasted spaces)
  
Actually I&#x27;m using Heimdall but I have not understood why &quot;link tiles&quot; are not alphabetically ordered, they are chronologically ordered. I read about Homer but it seems it does not satisfy requirement 2; also seen Organizr but is too complex.
 ​
 Thx as usual!!!

                    <span>Hello,
 I looking for self-hosted email server where:
 - I can automate create new e-mails and delete old/unused e-mails (built in feature or API)
 - I can set limits for sent messages per mail address.
 - Works on Linux
 - OpenSource (or really good free plan :D )
 Do you know any product that would meet these requirements?

                    <span>Hello everyone, 
 I&#x27;ve been lurking here for quite a while and I&#x27;m beginning to pick up quite a few things about selfhosting - thanks for the helpful guides! I&#x27;m wondering if I can use a docker container to host a touchscreen-optimized Firefox VNC which my mother can use on her iPad 2 to get a better web browsing experience (read: doesn&#x27;t crash when loading cnn.com). I&#x27;ve looked into RemoteApp on Windows, but as I don&#x27;t have any licenses, I can&#x27;t really make that happen. Help would be very much appreciated.
 Thanks!

                    <span>This blog post from James Reynolds, delves into using Fedora CoreOS, Portainer, and WordPress in 7 easy steps. The magic of Fedora CoreOS is that it configures itself at install time, including installing Portainer and enabling the host firewall. Once configured, you can quickly and repeatedly set up this server without logging into it. Then you can use Portainer to run any container or docker-compose file like WordPress. By firewalling Portainer you protect your admin interface from possible attacks while leaving the services rendered by your other containers accessible.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not usually the tinfoil hat type but targeted ads are really starting to rub me the wrong way. This post (instagram link FYI) in particular rang alarm bells in my head this morning.
 Ive been meaning to trial hosting a PiHole instance on my Unraid server at home for the last few months and I think I just got the push I needed to take the plunge and give it a shot. From what I understand (I&#x27;ve done 0 reading of documentation so far) you host it, set up your preferences and then point all your devices to it as a DNS. I assume I could just set that on my Router and it would auto push that setting to all my devices inside my LAN through DHCP at the point of next timeout, or just clear the table and let it do its thing.
 My question is that assuming all the above is correct, if not a little oversimplified, I could probably also tunnel all my devices that are outside of my LAN through Wireguard and route them through my home internet connection as well, thereby benefiting from PiHole while outside of my LAN, right? Has anyone else attempted a similar thing? My home internet connection isn&#x27;t blazing fast but it doesn&#x27;t have a data cap. If this is something thats doable I would seriously consider upgrading my connection if it required it.
 Side note: I also realize that PiHole isn&#x27;t some magic bullet that stops all this tracking garbage in its tracks but it can significantly reduce how many ads make it to my screens which is a step forwards for me.

                    <span>Hi all-
 I&#x27;m at a loss at what to do here. I genuinely try to figure this out on my own but for some reason paperless is being difficult. I&#x27;m running several apps already (bitwarden, nextcloud, snipe-it, a health server, peertube, to name a few). I struggled with all of them at some point in time but managed to google-fu my way through to get what i need. Now more and more its becoming easier to set things up and get them running. If it helps - I also work in software. I&#x27;m not a developer, but I do have a basic understanding of how things are supposed to work.
 Having said all that, after some googling - it sounded like paperless-ng is exactly what i needed next for my solutions i&#x27;m doing. One of the biggest factors is that it was super simple to stand up and get running. However, reading …</span>

 Does anyone know of a WebDAV management software or script, preferably with a web ui? Which would make it dead simple to create and remove WebDAV users and folder access - just with simple checkboxes.

                    <span>Hi.
 I&#x27;m looking for a self-hosted email forwarder, that would allow me to redirect all emails sent to addresses ending with a specific suite of characters to an other email address. For example, it would forward all emails sent (To, Cc, Bcc) to any email ending with [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com) (anything.user@example.com and [anythinguser@example.com](mailto:anythinguser@example.com)) to user@gmail.com ; [user2@example.com](mailto:user2@example.com) (anythinguser2@example.com and anything.user2@example.com) to [user2@gmail.com](mailto:user2@gmail.com) ; etc.
 Any idea where I could find something like that, preferably that I can install using docker ?
 Thank you in advance

                    <span>I’m trying to set up Cloudfare using DDClient to host from my Raspberry Pi. When I run 
  
Sudo ddclient-daemon&#x3D;0 -verbose -noquiet
  
I receive back “HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request” as part of the Receive after attempting the connection to cloudfare server. My conf file has the server listed as-
  
server&#x3D;api.cloudfare.com/client/v4
  
Which from what I can tell, should be the current working server to use. When I go to that URL, it displays the same JSON message of “No route for that URI” and “code:7000”.
 As far as I can tell there is no issue logging in or anything, since I’m pretty sure it can’t even establish a connection to login into.

                    <span>Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. 
 I currently have an 8GB Raspberry Pi running OpenMediaVault and an 8TB external hard drive set up with most of my data on it (mostly just random files). I initially started this as a hobby, but I&#x27;ve found myself getting more into it, and using OMV on a practical level. I have some docker containers set up (nextcloud, nginx, home assistant, adguard, and a few others). I run regular backups of my phone and PC, and am looking into the possibility of backup up all of my photos there too (thanks Google).
 I want to add more storage and at least one other drive for backup/redundancy. Before I start spending money and building out, I wanted some thoughts opinions on how to go about this...
 I&#x27;m currently satisfied with the Raspberry Pi running OMV, is there any need to buy a full NAS? What are your thoughts about just buying a 4-bay external hard drive enclosure and adding drives? The 8TB I currently have is an external drive from Costco. Can I just get away with buying another one of those? If I get a multi-bay external enclosure, could upgrade to a more powerful server in the future?
 I&#x27;m stuck at the moment, as I don&#x27;t know which way is the best to go. I&#x27;m looking for best bang for the buck while keep some flexibility to upgrade (storage and performance) in the future. 
 Sorry for my scattered thoughts. Any help, feedback, suggestions, etc would be extremely helpful. Thank you!

                    <span>I&#x27;m completely new to this and was following along an online book &quot;Obey the Testing Goat&quot; setting up a server using Nginx, Gunicorn, and Django to host on the Pi. I got it working well using my domain name I purchased from GoDaddy for a buck, but I wanted to try and make it so it&#x27;s accessible more than locally.
 I learned a tiny bit about Dynamic DNS and heard DDclient + CloudFare is a good option to go with. If I understand this right, which I probably don&#x27;t, then I need to add a CNAME record on GoDaddy which routes to CloudFare. From CloudFare, I need a couple A records which point to my Pi&#x27;s public IP, which is not static, so DDclient updates it continually.
 How do I set this up? How do I know what CNAME record I need to add to GoDaddy, or am I doing it wrong altogether?
 Currently, going to my domain gives me an error -
  
&quot;Error 1002: DNS points to local or disallowed IP&quot; 
  
Which according to Google, a DNS record points to CloudFares servers and I need to update my A-records. Not entirely sure what to make of this. I&#x27;m fairly certain I need to update my CName on GoDaddy but I really don&#x27;t know what to update it to.
 On a sidenote, I&#x27;m not entirely sure my DDclient is working properly either and need to update the conf file, but unfortunately I do not have access to it at the moment or the logs it gives me.

                    <span>I have a media server that I host now on an RPi4. The exposed stuff is jellyfin and seafile. 
 This works really well for just home use, but I would like to build a better server to accomodate for more ppl. Specifically my question is, and this is assuming my bandwidth is high enough to do all of this: 
  
Is there a good way to figure out what specs I need for lets say 4-5 concurrent streams (maybe x265, so hw decoding?) 
 If I would build a PC to do this, I would still aim for low idle power usage (4-5 streams is probably peak), and for 80% the server will be quite unused.
 How do I do this raid thing in a normal PC and how do I assert other than having an offsite backup that I have data redundancy for my seafile clients
  
Any resource is helpful thanks

                    <span>Id like to access my home PC via VNC or something similiar. Can you recommand a sfotware that makes it possible to see the screen that is shown to the connected screens instead of a virtual one? Also it would be great if i could toggle between both screens with a hotkey on a one screen device. Ever used such features?

                    <span>This is probably a weird one, but I&#x27;m going to hold a contest for my YouTube channel, and am looking for a Self Hosted system to have the users register on. Trying to make this as easy as possible, vs having to manually move comments or tweets or whatever other method over, then get it all into some randomizer. I will absolutely do that if there&#x27;s nothing else, but looking for any self hosted, open source options, or ideas you all may have of a good way to automate this. 
 It&#x27;s my first go round with a give away, but I&#x27;m excited about doing it. At the same time I&#x27;m nervous about it, and want it to be as fair as possible.
 I&#x27;m looking to simply get an email address, and whether the person needs the 120 V or 240 V kit I&#x27;m giving away. Once winners have been chosen, I&#x27;ll contact them via the email to get shipping info, etc.
 I figured I could do it on my RocketChat system with a special channel, but wasn&#x27;t sure how to get the user info into a useable tool to randomly select the person. Maybe there&#x27;s a plugin for it that I haven&#x27;t found yet. 
 Any ideas or suggestions are much appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been looking around and didnt find anything, so I&#x27;m not sure if those exist.
 I want a simple software, just to generate a PO digitally instant of paper.
  
Nice to have : Generate next PO number.
 Enter the products I buyed, qty, price (Ability to add a comment line would be nice).
 &quot;check box&quot; when they are received. (Ability to checkbox if I also got the invoice would be nice).
 Print the PO (PDF?) to join with the invoice (from another system) at the end.
  
​
 I&#x27;ve seen many &quot;ERP&quot;, but I don&#x27;t want a whole flow, just something simple, but not an Excel Sheet.
 Thanks! :)
 ​
 edit: Found &quot;SpendMap&quot;. There&#x27;s a Free Desktop version... not the best, but will do for now.

                    <span>I am looking for some sort of way to better organize and search documents. I currently have a Synology NAS that has a directory of documents. This includes PDFs, Word Documents, Excel Documents and other office type documents. I have them sort of organized by folders, but sometimes a document could potentially live in one of several folders and of course I usually forget where I put them. I want some sort of software that can search this. Ideally, I&#x27;d want to be able to tag files and possibly have the text searchable. I have looked at a few of the document management apps, but those seem to want to pull the documents into their own storage. I&#x27;d rather just point the software at the existing directory and have it process the metadata.
 Any ideas?

                    <span>Hello all. I feel like I am very close to getting things running, but I have a couple of issues. When I go to my domains section of mailcow admin and click DNS, this is the information in the modal:
 https://i.imgur.com/1UJLY5l.png
 So issue #1 is that I think the server is expecting/listening for the the wrong public IP. I have tried to look everywhere to change this setting, but I failed 😞. Does this mismatch matter? If so where do I change/hardcode this?
 Issue #2 is smaller, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to make the TSLA certificate be &quot;Connection refused&quot; instead of the actual hash of the certificate... 
 Also ports 80 and 443 for my mail.domain.tld go to a reverse proxy server and then to mailcow, whereas the mail ports go to mailcow directly from the router. My inbound and outbound port 25 is blocked by ISP. With the port checking tool, I am able to verify that all other mail ports on my public IP are listening. 
 The TSLA issue I guess is an optional setting, but I think the mismatch in the IPs are not allowing the mail server to listen properly, resulting in bounces: 
 https://i.imgur.com/EYx5Usc.png
 Not sure if the PTR record matters all too much either, if it does I can see about getting it modified. For the record, I&#x27;ll probably be sending out through a relay, but I need to be able to receive on my own. If not, are there good options that can forward all mail to me?
 I also have a VPS which I guess I can tunnel to and set up all my DNS records to go there. If I forward all the mail ports from the VPS to mailcow, would that work? Man, I&#x27;m not looking forward to getting the iptables setup for dockerized mailcow to use a wireguard interface for wan. But I guess I saw the iptables config in some file so I could potentially just modify that. I don&#x27;t know, I rather go through my public IP route... 
 If someone can help me out, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it! Thanks!

                    <span>Hi
 I recently started running Gitea in Docker and would like to use it to manage and modify my Wordpress files and Docker-compose yml files. I have around 40 docker images running on my QNAP (NAS).
 is this possible?
 Furthermore, it would be absolutely great if, Jenkins recognizes those changes and releases the docker image with it. to save time
 is this (functionality) possible? Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find much documentation about it.
 ​
 my situation:
 At the moment I edit my docker-compose files manuelly via Notepad++ and with &#x27;docker-compose up&#x27; I bring them up in the air. but then I have no version control and I have to manually deploy the relevant image every time.

 just wanna summerize here my experiences related with the object of the topic. This is a sort of organized recap of my previous thread, read it for more info and details. Really thanks to all of those users that wrote there, helping me a lot and doing the big part of the job.
 So, the question is: you some selfhosted services on your own lan and they or you need to use https protocol, or similar ones, and therefore you have to use some sort of certificates, avoiding the self signed ones because browser do not like them. You also want to reduce the effort in the management of this problem, automating all that is possible.
 SOLUTION 1:
 You can install and configure your own PKI+CA, release certificates etc... but this approach causes you need to import your root CA certificat…</span>

 I&#x27;d like to assess them side-by-side but am not sure if they interfere with each other.

 I&#x27;m a Minecraft noob - like, literally, never played the game. I&#x27;m gifting it to my 6 year old for their birthday and am curious if I should set up a server for them from the start, or if that&#x27;s something that can wait?
 They&#x27;ll start off playing on Android tablets (Bedrock Edition), and possibly also on the Nintendo Switch.
 I&#x27;m running unraid and have plenty of headroom to add a docker for it... just wondering what the pros and cons are? What are the benefits? What are the downsides?
 Thanks!

 hope it fits this sub.
 I&#x27;m looking for an alternative to retroshare, actually what i&#x27;m trying to achieve - is friend-to-friend network with options for chat/forum/minimal file storage. The main focus is privacy (not anonymity).
 Some people are not tech-savvy, so i&#x27;m looking more simple solution (client side).

                    <span>Hi,
 My current job requires repetitive typing with small variations (e.g. &quot;car door: undamaged vs damaged&quot;).
 I am looking for some sort of (ideally web-based) self-hosted/open-source free text editor that can handle custom templating, that then exports to plain text.
 Does this exist, or am I going to have to make it myself (e.g. using React with one of the text editing libraries)?
 Thanks!

 I saw an Docker Container for Mail alias a while ago, but I could not find it again and I cannot remember the name.
 It just let you create alias to forward them to your mail address.

 Apple keynote remembered me of this and I thought some of you will probably know one.

 What would be the best alternative:

                    <span>tldr; I hadn&#x27;t quite realized how utterly spoiled I was by Google Calendar until I moved off it and would love some help having better expectations for self-hosted solutions.
 I&#x27;ve tried NextCloud and just finished setting up Baikal, but I&#x27;m struggling with understanding what I should expect from these systems. I use a few different calendar clients personally, depending on the platform I&#x27;m working on.
 Something pretty critical to me is smooth handling of email invites. I send and receive invites to folks who are using Exchange, Gmail, and whatever else on their phones. (None of them are using my CalDAV server.) Nextcloud proved super confusing on that front: invites received from NC don&#x27;t integrate nicely into Outlook, for instance, so the recipient still has to open an attached ics file…</span>

                    <span>Hi selfhosted- somewhat new hoster here with docker running and NPM for my reverse proxy. 
 What are the methods people have used to secure external facing services, but still allowing access via apps? One scenario I’m trying to figure out is sharing emby with friends/family who’d use a Smart tv app. Is it possible to secure emby behind proxy authentication or a SSO and still be accessible via a typical TV app? Or is the only option to have end users log in on a laptop?

                    <span>Hey,
 I am using Syncthing for all my files management across my devices and I am currently using my big-fat-old computer in order to store big files, using an old 1 terrabyte HDD in order to store medias I rarely use but want to keep (ig photos and some music).
 Is it a good idea to zip the files ? How do you access your datas and is there more elegant ways to navigate my photos over the file manager ? And finally, what are the alternatives to google photos for A.I. ? 
 If there is a good one that works locally it would be super nice :D
 ​
 Sorry if the questions are too much &#x27;trivial&#x27;.
 Have a pleasant day :)

                    <span>How do you start from nothing, build a base docker image, then update that image and use that image to build an app (N8N in this case) all self-hosted and with your own Private ProGet Docker repo. Part of a Zero to Code for non Devs to follow.
 What I love about this is it&#x27;s all hosted on my tiny dev environment, Jenkins, Proget, Gitlab, docker etc.. 
 This post is long, very long, however, I wanted to get everything I needed into one place as there are few places on the internet that document such a test in all its glory.. this might help someone

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve been running unraid on a pretty standard 8 bay mini itx case for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve started to outgrow it.
 So, to dip my toes into the proper server waters, I picked up one of these, for what I was pretty sure was a steal at $200.
 I wanted to wait until I had it in person to figure out just what else I&#x27;d need to get it up and running, and now that I do, I&#x27;ve ordered the following:
 CPUs: https://www.ebay.com/itm/254916366162?ssPageName&#x3D;STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;_trksid&#x3D;p2060353.m2749.l2649

 Closest I could come to that does what I want is afterlogic, but its a paid service and I don&#x27;t think its open source.
 Edit: afterlogic is open source, so that is good. And they do have a free lite version, but no calendar/carddav support in the lite version. The paid version would be okay, but updates are only supported on a per year basis, so after a year you need to buy it again for any updates.

                    <span>Hey everybody, personally I use Bitwarden for my passwords, but I&#x27;ve been doing a little bit of research recently and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a password manager that supports this, that being storing secrets / passwords in AWS. So I&#x27;m coming to you guys to see if this is something you&#x27;ve seen before or would be interested in. It would be self-hosted, I would not provide any hosting whatsoever since I would have access to the access key and the secret key the AWS provides, so there&#x27;d be no trust that I would be able to provide on my side. However, if somebody has already done this, I would be interested in reviewing the code for it. Thank you

                    <span>So I’m thinking of building a new server for my increasing needs, below are the services I’m hoping to host on the new server. This server does not need to fit into a rack but will be on 24/7.
  
Nextcloud (Family use so under 5 users, but used for file backups and sync)
 PhotoPrism (Family use so under 5 users, but used for image backups and sync)
 Jellyfin (Family use so under 5 users, but almost never streaming at the same time)
 Custom apps (Apps that I make, almost no resource use, just things that need to be run on an always on server)
 Plus a little room to expand in case I want to host something new
  
Here is a link to what I’m thinking of getting on PC part picker: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/CcY3p2
 Nextcloud says it needs ~ 8 GB of ram and ~ 6 cores for 25 users so I expect to be using ~ 4 GB ram and ~ 3 cores. PhotoPrism says it needs ~ 4 GB of ram and ~ 2 cores but also says “Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should match the number of cores. ” Jellyfin has people saying it works fine with ~2 GB of ram and I expect it to use less than 2 cores And my custom apps should use way less than 2 GB of ram and less than 2 cores
 I didn’t think I needed a graphics card as 1) they are incredibly high in price rn and 2) I didn’t think any of my hosted apps would take advantage of it. Do you see a problem with this?
 Also, I’m having a problem choosing my storage. I want fast storage but with my budget (Preferably less than $700) and my internet connection (Around 100 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up), I’m not sure that I would see a difference between an HDD vs M.2 SSD. Do you have any recommendations on this?
 As a side note, I have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse laying around that I can use for this build, and am planning on putting a Linux distro on it.
 Do you see any problems with my build? Thanks for all of the help in advance!

                    <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;m currently writing a backup script. I have several services which are run via docker-compose. My basic idea was to stop all of them -&gt; backing up the compose files, config + volumes and then restart. But how can I do that? 
 The idea was to use labels for the containers to know which should be backed up. I can get them without a problem via bash. After that I just wanted to start them again. But how do I do that? A simple docker start &quot;container&quot; is not enough because this would not start other containers which are the base for some services. So I have to use docker-compose up -d to start them again. But for this I need to get the path to the docker-compose file. But I only have the id of the container.
 Any ideas?

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I’ve been bit with the privacy bug and decided to self host my business files. So I went ahead and acquired a NUC so that I can run Nextcloud and connect to it via VPN when I’m not at home. 
 The thing is I’m reasonably tech savvy but completely useless when it comes to command line and Linux. I intended for this to be a quick operation to setup so I can get back to work- but man was I wrong. I have no clue what’s going on to the point where following the wikis I get lost. (I.e. ignition file for CoreOS). 
 Can someone just point me in the right direction?

                    <span>I have been using command line and messing for servers for a good while now and I have just recently seen how people are hosting multiple platforms on one singular machine and I am confused on how. 
 I have vaguely heard of virtual host with nginx or Apache whatever it was but I am still unsure on how to host a (for example) jellyfin server with a pi-hole server.
 Does it have something to do with assigning ports?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I’m a fairly new VPS owner and this sub gave me so much ideas! I’m looking for a web analytics solution that doesn’t rely on a tracker (the code snippet you have to embed everywhere), but instead gets information from the system logs, similar to Awstats. 
 Awstats is great but I’m looking for something with more features and that is more visually appealing 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Title basically. I managed my reverse proxy configuration like any other web server. When I deploy a new service, I add the subdomain to my configuration file in nginx and restart the server afterwards. I also apply my SSL cert through this. 
 NPM seems easier to manage and it looks like I can basically re-use my entries for each subdomain in the advanced settings that lets you apply your own settings instead of ticking checkboxes. Thoughts? Send it? Don&#x27;t do it?

                    <span>Ive been workin on a Beowulf cluster computer made out of some raspberry pis. Currently it is running Kubernetes (K3s) and MPI, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any experience with PVM as a clustering solution. In theory, it seems like it&#x27;d be easier to manage than mpiexec&#x27;ing every command, but I&#x27;m quite new to all this, so it may not be. Once I get K3s fully up n runnin it may prove things to be simpler than I&#x27;m expecting.
 So yeah, whataya think¿ I&#x27;ve done a wee bit of research on PVM and there&#x27;s not a ton out there, am I just lookin in the wrong place¿ Is PVM horribly outdated (the website certainly was lmao)¿ Thanks¡

I am in need of an alternative to google photos that can run on a PC that I have running that I also use for Plex. My main purpose of this is mainly to share photos with family and friends. My girlfriend is an amateur photographer and needs something similar to google photos for sharing to clients. I am hopeful to find a program that can run in windows 10 similar to Plex as it would be easiest in my current setup. Thanks!!

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m running wireguard using the linuxserver/wireguard docker image.
 I managed to get the connection working between containers on two different host.
 Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on:
 Host A &gt; container A &gt; Network &lt; container B &lt; Host B
 I got the bold areas to connect (i.e. wg container on host A can ping wg container on host B, but cannot reach the host)
 &#x60;docker exec&#x60; into the container and ping the other host: ok
 ssh into host and ping the other host: not reachable
 What can we do with the docker container config or wg config to allows host A to ping host B?
 I would like to keep all changes made within the computer instead of on the host itself it at all possible. Perhaps some volume mounts or something?
 Only if there is really really no way to do this without modifying host files, will I consider doing so.
 Any help appreciated!

                    <span>Hey,
 I want to create multiple &quot;sections&quot; and allow users to upload content (PDF, images etc) in a section, via their browser.
 The user should not register or be required to create a new account. I should password protect each section and anybody who has the credentials should be able to upload in that section. 
 The end result would be me giving a link+credentials to a person/group. Everybody who has the link+credentials should be able to upload anything on my server, in that specific section, via that URL.
 S3 integration would be highly appreciated. 
 Any hints?
 Thank you!

 How is the search in roundcube or rainloop? Any better solutions?

                    <span>Hello, I’d like to move my nginx configurations from an apt installation to Docker (probably nginx proxy manager). Let’s say I’ve set it up, I’ll have WireGuard and nginx_pm in separate containers. WireGuard is setup so that it uses my host network because that’s what I found was the easiest. How would I keep nginx_pm on its own network (and possibly move WireGuard to its own network) but have directives to proxy traffic to the WireGuard container?

                    <span>Hello ! 
 We are currently using Tallyfy which is a great tool but it’s too expensive for our usage. 
 https://tallyfy.com
 We use it when we need to onboard or offboard employees to make sure everyone in the team is doing their part of the job. 
 It’s a really nice tool, far from the scary workflow management tools I have seen elsewhere. 
 Do you have any idea about something similar which could be self hosted ? 
 Thanks !

Windows and Mac both have speech recognition built-in; surely there is something out there that lets me take an audio file and get the resulting text from it without going through Google cloud or something else?

 Use case: Podcasts and videos with information in them, lectures, etc. I don&#x27;t need it to be 100% accurate.

                    <span>I recently leased a VPS to host a few services, and took the first steps towards locking down the server (Ubuntu Server 20.04).
 What I have done so far:
  
Update &amp; Upgrade the system
 Install / enable unattended-upgrades &amp; apt-listchanges (automatically install important updates daily, and monitor/list changes automatically)
 Create a non-root user, add to sudoers
 Lock down SSH 
 Change to a nonstandard port
 Create &amp; configure key based SSH login (key protected with password)
 Disable root login via SSH
 Disable password login via SSH
 
 Configure Firewall 
 Create rule to allow but limit SSH in on new port
 Create rules to allow in, on other necessary ports (for me just 80 and 443)
 Set default deny for everything else.
 Rule to drop ping requests
 Enable firewall
 
 Setup fail2ban for SSH 
 Rather relaxed 15/15/15 rule (15 failed logins, in 15 minutes &#x3D; 15 minute ban)
 
 Check to make sure apparmor is enabled and in enforcement mode
  
​
 On the to-do / research list are (1) setting up mail so important system mail is sent (or forwarded from &#x27;root&#x27;) to my actual e-mail address (2) figuring out backups of some sort
 ​
 What additional steps would you take?
 What have I left out / forgotten / got wrong?

 Has anyone done this? Can I take a peek at your config? I&#x27;m totally at loss here. I&#x27;ve been googling for days :D
 I&#x27;m suspecting I have to do some custom nginx config for Taiga, but none of the stuff I have tried so far has worked. I&#x27;m not all that sure how I should get those VIRTUAL_HOST and LETSENCRYPT_HOST environment variables across to nginx-proxy either.

It needs to be very very very low bandwidth, something that just sends text and is secure. I need it to be web based so that I can access it from a work computers web browser. What direction do I need to look into for this? Thanks!

                    <span>I have a HP Proliant DL180 G6. I have two dilemmas. One being I shut my power off to do some electrical work is adding outlets to my house. I forgot to unplug/shutdown server. But all SAS drives are functional I checked the bays lights and all the drives show up in the Smart array manager. But one of the drive says rebuilding 0.19%. while rebooted from Windows server 2019, appreciation of the power again while I was rebuilding. Here&#x27;s the real dilemma. I transferred a couple terabytes worth of data over to the server. It had my entire movie and DVD collection and TV shows, over 400 movies and over 50 full tv shows s1-end. Two questions.
  
Is there a way to recover or rebuild the drive cuz every time I try just it will send my screen no black screen or just not recover.

                    <span>Does anyone know if any Wiki style software exists for Github, or some other revision control system. I like the use a github system for my code, but I also need a wiki for random notes and things related to sysadmin and security; I figured they are quite similar that something might exist which faciliates both.
 Any suggestions?

                    <span>Hello
 Is there any alternative to pm2 that also has a dashboard to monitor the processes and doesn&#x27;t have a free process limit?
 Can either be Self-Host, Open-Source or hosted but unlimited processes.
 Thank you

                    <span>I have this server and I want to self-host Nextxloud in it. I tried and tested running publicly by ngrok, it&#x27;s working, great. However, is there any tunneling sites like ngrok that I can use this Nextcloud publicly for free maybe? Thanks Rookie here :D

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to get some feedback before pulling the trigger on a build. I&#x27;m essentially following JDM_WAAAT&#x27;s NAS killer 5.0 guide and just want to know how it still holds up, or if there are better options since it is a year old. Usage will be primarily Plex/Sonarr/Radarr/Jackett/qBittorrent with one local client and possibly ~2 remote streams. I plan on getting into unRaid/Docker and exploring additional projects. I&#x27;ve never built a computer before so any feedback/resources/advice would be appreciated.
 CPU: i7-5775C or i7-4790 (whichever I can get for &lt;$150/$200)
 Motherboard: Asus z97-A
 Ram: 4x8gb whatever is compatible/cheap
 Cache: 1tb ssd
 Array: 7x6tb WD Reds
 Case: CoolerMaster n400
 Miscellaneous: power supply, fans, cpu cooler, SATA cables, SATA power cables, thermal paste
 This is the general idea, but is there anything I&#x27;m forgetting overlooking? Any concerns/bottleneck/connection issues I should be aware of? I want to spend under $2k all in.

                    <span>I can’t decide between mailcow, docker-mailserver and mailu. All look good. I currently use modoboa, it’s great but I need a solution which lives in Docker. A database-less or SQLite deployment is preferred because the VPS I use doesn’t have a lot of resources. I also hate databases. Autoconfig is preferable but there’s a separate docker image that can provide this functionality. 
 So what’s your experience with the three above?

                    <span>RSo for months I&#x27;ve been preparing for this. Scoped out hardware upgrades to my personal server, purchasing storage space to prepare for &quot;The Great TakeOut&quot;ing. See my wife and I have relied on Google Photo backups to keep copies of our marriage and family journey for the past 10+ years. Obviously they&#x27;re not High-Res 4k images or videos, but as a family photo album, using our daily driver devices, it&#x27;s been perfect. 
 As Google started showing signs of dropping this feature, I played with other incorporated &amp; pre-existing replacements which I had access. 
 Always back burner projects due to a busy life. 
 I used Amazon Photos as a Prime Member. It was fine, but UI was garbage. I bought in to Plex as a lifetime member while it was in Beta for totally legal media server uses, and was pleasa…</span>
