 So I am looking for a solid software for a non profit organization. This is what I need the software to be able to do:
  
Store membership details: name of member, chapter name, chapter location.
 Able to filter search results by chapter name, or city.
 Good organization of data, for example each city contains several chapters, each chapter contains several members. So city --> chapters within that city --> members within that chapter.
 Keep track of membership, no need to be able to process payment, but reminders or indicators preferred for membership fees every 1 year.
 Clear, simple and effective interface - we work with a lot of visually impaired people, so looking for someone that they would be able to use as well.
  
Some additional notes:
  
No need for website. This software is only going to be used by the admin team.
 Since it's a non profit organization, would love for the price to be reasonable. Not quite sure what the budget would be but will be happy with a reasonable price if the piece of software is good.
 The way I am kind of thinking about it is Microsoft Access, but more straightforward, modern and preferably on the cloud.
  
I would be happy to provide any more details or answer any questions. Thank you so much in advance for helping me out!

 I am running a bunch of containers on docker on my synology nas and two containers in particular and a few others are for network monitoring tools. In this scenario i am using wireshark and ntopng. When running the containers they are showing 172.17.0.1 as local. On this nas i have one router on lan 1 and another (Vpn) router on lan 2. How can i make it show it says lan 1 and it's devices (192.168.0.1) and lan 2 and it's devices (192.168.1.1) I suspect i will have an issue when i setup grafana and all that stuff. Would this have to be a macvlan? I access all my docker container's via my nas ip which follows lan 1 - 192.168.0.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

 How do you handle your back-ups?
 Are there any backup solutions when self-hosting that you can just set up once and never have to worry about again (as long as nothing breaks, at least)?
 With the same "safety" as when using a subscription service, so the backups are not just on a separate drive in the same computer but at a completely different location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm new to all of this and the definitions of words and concepts are overwhelming. So when I googled "on-premises" sometimes it's required to have your server in your home/organisation but sometimes it's still" on-prem" if you rent a server as long as you're the one in charge over the software and the provider does not give you software and server as a whole.
 So if renting a server is allowed and running your bought software on it, isn't that IaaS? And if it really is IaaS, it would make no sense to say "on-premises vs. cloud" because IaaS is also a part of Cloud Computing. It seems to me that often cloud and SaaS are used synonymous.
 In addition, sometimes I read "on-premises software (self-hosting)" as it was the same. But for me, having your own server (rented or bought) is somewhat your "own cloud" at home. And that would contratdict the whole "on-premise vs. cloud" thing. But maybe this is a false understanding of the concept and for the last point, I see why "own cloud at home" is more a metaphor when acknowledging that Cloud Computing is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS and it's somehow weird to offer a service to oneself :-) 
 Thanks for reading

Isn't it a bit of a chicken and egg problem. As sites get taken down the project is forked elsewhere. At core what I'm asking is if rather than creating multiple proxies and making the system difficult to penetrate creating multiple forks of the site all hosted in different locations is the best choice??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I need help to configure my DNS on my domain.
 The situation:I have a domain and I created a DDNS entry, I used ddclient and everything is works fine now with the IP update and everything. However, I host 2 servers on my machine, until recently I had 2 different DDNS to the same IP and then an SRV Record that pointed to them for the servers to work.
 I want however to use only one DDNS IP and somehow use SRV records to point all my servers to that one. I however have little experience with all of that so I don't really understand how I am supposed to continue.
 Simply put, I have currently:
 cs.domain.com which points to my ipmc.domain.com which points to my IP again, andip.domain.com which again points to the same IP.
 my ddclient updates ip.domain.com regularly, but not the other two.
 my SRV records point one to the cs (cs._udp.domain.com) and one to the mc DDNS entries (mc._tcp.domain.com). I can easily fix the issue by just updating all 3 DDNS Entries, but I feel like there should be an easier solution.
 For further questions feel free to ask me, and thanks in advance.

 Basically, until now most of my accounting was running in spreadsheets, but I am seeking more automation, but ideally also want to be able to plug into HMRC (my company is all remote, but since you need to put a pin on a map somewhere, for us that is London). It should fulfil all requirements and I want to be able to have control over the data, but it should also be sitting on a modern platform, so I won't have to move everything again soon.Whilst access to compute resources won't be an issue (we're a software company), ease of use is: Right now we don't have any admin staff (yet). Where do I best start? Would invoice ninja be suitable or am I running into the wrong direction looking at that?
 I appreciate pointers that might help me or questions I should be asking.

 I can get this using this plugin:
 https://github.com/texxasrulez/additional_imap
 And did some ajusts:
 ​
  
Delete all custom config from gmail and gmx(or other if you use it) of /plugins/additional_imap/config.inc.php
 
Enabled "Show real names for special folders" in Settings->preferences->Special Folders
 
Add rc3k_ prefix to plugin tables on DB.
 
 ​
 To be a perfect solution, only miss one little thing:
 ​
 ALL INBOXES Option
 ​
 There is no multi-accs-webmail-imap-reader with a nice interface available for free/selfhosted, this roundcube+additional_imap its the closest solution that i can found.
 Im a happy user of SparkMail, but they dont have a web/win version.
 Nextcloud Mail app do the job, but is too slow and buggy...

 If you know a better solution, please send it here! Thanks

 After many many years of ignoring reverse proxy, I sat down today to finally set one up. I have spent the morning looking over many videos and different ways of doing it, but it seems that most of them want you to have your sites remotely accessible. In my case, I want a simple method of accessing all my services without remembering what ports and addressing they would be on. I know that MDNS does a lot of it. But it's no good for nested services with ports. I've started to dive into the SWAG documentation. I'm not sure if ngix manager or swag would be a better fit. My google-fu has failed me, or maybe I'm being impatient to find the right tutorial. 
 I'm looking to pull off, something as easy as:
 homeassistant.local
 sab.local
 smokeping.localdomain. 
 octoprint
 unfi.localdomain
 omv.localdomain 
 portianer.local
 ​
 then I want to configure some sort of easy home page like homer that my wife and I can easily find. Can anyone point me to a video or blog that would be able to guide me through?

 Following up on a previous post. Thanks for the kind and constructive feedback! We have considered the most requested features and crafted a Public Roadmap. 
 Check it out here https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee/projects/2 and please let us know what you think.
 We are behind in features comparing to Tailscale or Zerotier, but I believe we are on the right path to cover most of them. Our main goal is a fully open-source system so that it can be r/selfhosted without any hidden parts.
 Shortly on main points from the roadmap:
 - Peer management with a UI dashboard so that you don't need to add peers manually
 - Automatic network changes provisioning so that every peer in the system has the latest state (and newly added peers)
 - Windows support
 - ACLs
 - Mobile clients
 We are a team of two and are looking for some help :). Feel free to reach out if you are willing to contribute.
 Cheers,

a server w/ 4c CPU and 32GB RAM
 2TB ZFS Pool (originally made by FreeNAS & Full of Data)
  
What I want:
  
preferably FOSS
 Web Interface
 Creation/editing/deletion of VMs
 Management for Docker (haven't dabbled in docker yet, but definitely want to)
 Ability to adopt existing ZFS-Pool
 Ability to mount directories on said ZFS pool to VM's directly (e.g. mount "/mnt/ZFS/music" on the host to "/music" on the VM without a network connecting host and VM)
 Ability to assign different VMs to different VLANs (on the host network)
 SMB File sharing
 maybe some load-balancing in the future (not required)
  
What I want this for:
  
local network file server (smb)
 reverse proxy (nginx)
 website host (nginx)
 mediaserver (don't know yet)
 VPN-Server (openvpn)
 Matrix Homeserver (don't know yet)
  
Does anyone know an OS that would check these boxes?
 I am asking because my FreeNAS boot stick died, and now that I have to redo it anyway, I'm wondering whether there is a better way to do this. (I am going to use a 128GB SSD for the next install to not repeat this error.)
 I have tried Proxmox as well, and it does a lot of these things right, but I cannot find a (GUI) way to do the mounting I described above, also doing all the ZFS and SMB configuration in the terminal only sounds like a recipe for a security disaster if I am the person configuring it, even though it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am a developer who has a vps for some basic stuff, but I guess this is not that important for this question. Scrolling through this sub I see some awesome things that would make life a lot easier, however I can't find a lot about the setup people use (config wise, not hardware). This sub has some awesome posts like what people use, what they've learned, how they failed, etc, but I'm more curious to how you've setup your server and what you like / dislike about the setup.
 For example, I'm planning to start self hosting and redo my vps setup in the following way:
 Ubuntu with docker, openssh, ufw and fail2ban, as I'm already familiar with this and it keeps it easy to what I've installed directly on Ubuntu itself. Then use Portainer with nginx reverse proxy to setup all the various services like NextCloud, wiki, etc. Probably setup 2 database instances (prod/dev) in case something breaks and so I can start fixing it without hurting production. Lastly, add something to back up the docker containers and config to an external party, just don't know which one yet. 
 What I like so far: - Little directly installed on Ubuntu itself so updates are easy and I can quickly see if the problem is with docker, the service or Ubuntu - Server wise it's a bit easier to make it secure with only a few things running on Ubuntu itself - Docker itself, just nice to have everything running in containers
 What I don't like / not sure of: - Pure my config, but current setup has 1 DB for all services - I've heard that securing and updating docker containers are an absolute nightmare (I'm pretty new to docker so not sure) - Everything is running on docker, so if docker fails all fails - For all new services I'll use I have to export and import the config in the dev database (or the other way around)
 So how did you guys set up your server and what do you like and dislike about it? Maybe share your experiences so far with different setups so new (rookie) members can learn :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run my homelab on a Proxmox machine. I have several LXC containers and a couple virtual machines, each running a single service. So far, everything is attached to the same bridge vmbr0, which is attached to the physical network card. Since I am getting a new drive, I wanted to reinstall my homelab and restructure its network, putting each service (or group of services) in its own network, so that they are properly isolated from each other and communication between them can be regulated by the firewall.
 The standard approach seems to be to make a series of bridges vmbrX, one for each network, and to create a virtual machine running pfSense or OPNSense managing such bridges, handling all the routing between them and vmbr0. I was wondering, however, if there is a way to do this without the additional virtual machine. Could Proxmox itself handle the routing in place of OPNSense? There are firewall settings, and there are multiple network settings (vlan, bridges, bonds), but I am not too familiar with the topic.
 Is there any good example of this setup, or do you have any advice?
 Notes:
  
 I do not want to use NAT. Ideally, I want my local network to be something like 172.16.0.0 and each service to be on something like 172.16.X.0, where the entire subnet can be reached from my local network (barring firewall, of course).

 ​
 I want to self host a watch together service so my friends and I can watch stuff off my home server. It would need to support basically mkv and mp4 video files, and I'd be okay with being the only one who has control over playback. 
 Basically, I just need to have a video stream to a webpage so my friends and I can watch it together. I have my own domain, so I just need the service.
 ​
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: I am running emby, so by the looks of things I may need to run a second media server side by side, or switch entirely. Any other suggestions are much appreciated though!

 I for some odd reason have been working on trying to get my HP Proliant DL180 G6 up with Windows Server 2019 with a mutual Raid 50 Drives. Its a 12 bay slot but I'm only using 7 currently. I have succesfully update and installed Windows Server 2019. I am having 2 issues. I have successfully installed Raid 50 and the install drive is a 500gb Drive seperate from the Raid 50.
 The first issue is setting up the Raid 50 for the VM and sharing it as an internal Drive. I dont care if its not C:\ but i need it to have a drive letter. I got the Raid 50 to show up once as Drive D:\ but it went away after a couple of minutes. Now it wont allow me to connect the Windows Server 2019 to Windows 10 VM through the ISCSI Initator. Ive tried to initialize the ISCSI device that was created in Server Management ----> Files and Storage Server -------> ISCSI
 But it always says cannot connected PC on both Windows Server 2019 and the Windows 10 Hyper-V VM.
 ​
 Ive also tried a share drive and an ISCSI and a server pool both fixed and dynamic. Ive tried rebootingt he VM and the HP Proliant DL180 G6
 I've copied the IQN, IP Adress from the Host Server 2019 Computer to Windows 10 VM and vice versa in ISCSI Initiator and i always get cannot connect to PC on both. Ive also tried to find a target and it wont allow me to add it. I have no idea what to do now. The storage pool is empty and i would prefer a fixed volume for faster transfer rates. I cant find the answer anywhere. Thank you ahead of time for all comments.
 ​
 ​
 2ND Issue:
 I Have a Nvidia Server graphics card. It doesn need a 6pin i have already installed the 16x rise. But Windows cant recognize the card can anyone help!

 Backstory:
 I used to use a Hetzner CX11 VPS for my Selfhosted apps. However, I wanted more storage and control. So, I brought myself a Raspberry Pi 4gb planning to use Cloudflare Tunnel to access my Raspberry Pi without opening ports on the house Router. However, I encountered problems with Cloudflare Tunnel, see below. 
 The main services that I host are:
 · Nextcloud

 As my Synology just passed away, I am in need of a file sync utility that I can install on my wife and son's windows installs to sync a directory back to the fileserver on the LAN.
 Because of this reason....
  
it needs to be free and open source
 
It needs to silently sync without user intervention
 
It needs to sync when files are added not at a predetermined schedule
 
 I used to use Synology Drive and it worked well.
 What do you gents use?
 I've heard some bad things about duplicati so would probably want to stay clear of it.
 Also, I'd like to not have to install a utility on my server for the sync to be possible, e.g. syncthing
 (I'm using rclone on an Ubuntu container to keep Google drive in sync with a few local directories, very happy)

Rather than individual credentials for each app, I've started learning about Authelia and have successfully set up a simple authentication process for a container. Now that I have this first step working, I'm a little confused on next steps to deploy it into action:
 For example, say I have a container with paperless. I can protect the web UI for that container with authelia without much trouble, but how do I make paperless aware that I am logged in? Do I disable the paperless login mechanism to it auto logs in a user? (this seems dangerous). Do I use the token option to log in via API?
 Maybe it is different for each container, but a general workflow of how it's supposed to work or where I can read some tutorial would be appreciated.

 so, I really wanted to and now even more so want to create a home server that I could use to host anything I like/test and etc. I got to a technology school so me and a friend did a project with an old cisco server that we put ESXi on, a switch and other stuff and that made me understand how it all works and pushed me to want to set it up for real this time, I got a switch, ap and all the things needed but the actual server. one person at my school told me how he uses an old laptop with ESXi as a server. so I was wondering what would be a good starting point since I searched a bit and found decommissioned servers for about £100 I think and I don't know if that is work or if to just do what that guy did and create a server from a laptop 
 thank you in advance

 I've been working on my own apps for my home media needs throughout covid. I just released the Server and Music apps and posted about it on /r/musichoarders. Even though this subreddit isn't music related, I think the project might be interesting to some of you.
 It's called Cardinal, and it's an ecosystem of apps for playing your media at home. Right now the Server and Music apps are available for macOS and Windows as early access releases, and soon the mobile Music app will be released. Planned apps are Photos, Books, and TV & Movies, which will all feed from the Server app.
 There's also a GitHub for technical info, where lots of the code has been open sourced.
 The apps are free to use and free of all types of advertising, tracking, and marketing. It would be nice to get feedback on whether people are interested in using something like this, because I would love to work on this long term if there's enough interest. Any and all feedback is welcome!

 I am building a cocktail bar in my dining room and I am looking to take it a step further buy giving my guests (friends and neighbors) a tablet with a menu of cocktails. Below are a few things I am looking to accomplish. 
  
Keep an inventory of all alcohol / liquor on hand
 Associate cocktails with ingredients and as each ingredient gets used alert me that we are running low based on inventory. 
 Allow guests to start a tab, and email them a receipt of cocktails ordered...this would help them remember what they liked last time they ordered. 
 Front end menu would be a menu with either hand selected cocktails (limit) or all cocktails (based on inventory of ingredients)
  
I am 99% confident that this doesn't exist in a self hosted product, but I am ok with hacking something together. Maybe a combination of something like SnipeIT + ? ... I dunno. Any suggestions are welcome!

 I've seen Homer but I don't think its meant to be used in an organisation and doesn't have Google SSO.

 ​
 Setup
 Server A) Proxmox Home server running multiple VMs (jellyfin - its own drive, nextcloud - its own zpool, wordpress and few other dockers in LVM on proxmox)
 Server B) dedicated Ubuntu mining machine that can double as backup server
 ----------------
 Questions
 Q1) I am not sure the right way to back server A. Do I back everything ideally like LVMs + Zpool data all together as one single thing? How does back up works?
 Q2) Technically, PBS could be handy to run on B, but Server B will be running chia/mining stuff on Ubuntu 24x7. I can add few more disks to it and automate backup on it from server A. How to do it?
 Q3) Its not a huge deal for me if I lose proxmox configuration, but definitely want Zpool and Jellyfin and VM (website coding etc) data auto backed up on server B. But then just why not back config anyway if its simple so if I ever drop a hammer on server A by accident, I can get replacement up really quick.
 Q4) What is better raid on Server A since I will have Server B backing up. Do I need to waste a disc on A for redundancy. Server B is already in a different location and will have Server C as cold backup later.

 ​
  
Can Drone CI somehow put my html code into a web service image and eventually deploy it to my website?
 Or can I have Drone CI put the code in a certain location on my NAS, so that a docker image that runs, picks it up and shows it on my website?
 or can Drone CI somehow execute a docker-compose.yml file?
  
​
 what is the easiest/fastest thing i can do to get this done?

 so what Iam trying to achieve:

 It's not yet ready to use (some core features are missing), but the idea is:
 Provide a (restricted) LDAP interface for services to list users and authenticate them, and a friendly web interface to manage the users. It's pretty opinionated (all users in the same OU, all groups in the same OU, limited query-only capabilities and so on) but should be sufficient for 90% of LDAP use cases, and has a *much* simpler deployment and management story than any full LDAP-based system.
 It's written in Rust to have minimal memory requirements, and the data is stored in SQL for simple backups. It would be absolutely trivial to wrap in a Docker container.
 If you are interested in contributing, check out https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap! Beginners welcome, I have some simple tasks to give if you're just starting with Rust.

 Can someone throw me a bone and a link / info on this.
 Dashboard, you click a button and it runs a command on the server. I'm thinking of using it to kick off docker images that run and do automated tasks such as create PDF reports based on numbers for work related stuffs.

 I am part of a group organizing a project. Most of the people are non-nerds and we need a tool to share information online. Normally Google Docs/Drive would be fine, but for idealistic reasons that is not desired. So I'm looking for a nice alternative that will allow us to 
 a) share files (PDF, images and so on) online 
 and
 b) be able to edit files via browser and especially
 smartphone, since most people are mobile users. It is enough to be able to edit text files. 
 There is no need for collaborative editing and text files are enough - no odt, no doc, plain text is fine.
 But it needs to be simple and it would be nice if it doesn't require a lot of additional apps on the phone.
 I skimmed the awesome selfhosted list, so far my best option would be Nextcloud and OnlyOffice pointing to the Nextcloud instance.
 Any better ideas out there? 
 Really perfect would be something like Mattermost, but with text editing (like an included Etherpad/Cryptpad feature). There is a Collabora plugin for Mattermost, but unfortunately it doesn't work on mobile/via the Mattermost app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I hope you won't laugh at me for this question because I'm a total noob at self-hosting and this will be my first try.
 I created an account on Hetzner and want to self-host these apps (I included what I use right now in brackets):
  
Ghost or Wordpress (using static site with 11ty - free)
 Linkding (using raindrop - free)
 Wallabag (using pocket - $2.73/year)
 MiniFlux (using miniflux hosting - $15/year)
 Nextcloud (using Google One - $6.88/year)
 Standard Notes (using InkDrop - free with dev license)
 Plausible (using goatcounter - free)
  
Because 1 Euro is equal to 10.26 Turkish Lira, I want to self-host these in smallest €2.49 CX11 server with these specs:
  
1 Intel vCPU
 2 GB Ram
 20 GB Disk Space
 20 TB Traffic
  
I won't use these apps regularly, I'll use them rarely. It will be mostly for learning purpose. I might even move to my current stack.
 So is this server specs enough for this purpose, if not what will be?

 ​
 I've learned a lot about self hosting in the last weeks, after a colleague told me about nextcloud.
 I bought a fully upgraded mac mini 2012, installed Virtualbox, created an ubuntuVM and set up docker + compose. I installed nextcloud and started experimenting with it.
 I got rid of my fiber internet access a few years ago because my mobile phone provider offers an additional data sim card for about $5/mo and my traffic is unlimited.
 But that plan isn't great: I'm behind CG-NAT (Carrier-grade NAT) which means there's no way for me to reach my server when I'm not on the home wifi because my public IP address is shared between several other customers.
 So I called them to enquire about public ipv4 addresses op…]]></summary>

 My setup is as follows:
  
Desktop with 4 TB HDD space, running Manjaro
 
Laptop with 250 GB SSD space, running Manjaro

Headless mini PC in a cupboard, connected to a 6 TB external HDD, intended as always-on server, running Ubuntu

 I want to be able to synchronize folders within my home folder between my laptop and desktop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just discovered this place and would like to introduce you to our open source routing engine:
 https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper#readme
 GraphHopper offers you the path finding functionality ("A to B routing") that you probably know from Google Maps and uses data from the incredible OpenStreetMap project (see also /r/openstreetmap).
 To fully self-host a route planner (e.g. a "Google Maps" equivalent) you need GraphHopper for the routing and two other parts: you also need some visualization aka "maps" (e.g. with OpenMapTiles) and you need the address search (e.g. with Photon).
 We have a hosted version of this and you can try it: GraphHopper Maps. It is also privacy friendly without any trackers.
 This web app is not (yet) as polished as Google Maps app but there are many projects that use the routing functionality of GraphHopper and offer "complete" apps like outdoor apps (komoot, trailrouter, ride with GPS, Locus Map, plotaroute, Kurviger) or other services (delivery hero, deutsche bahn, GLS, ...)
 And GraphHopper can be used for more things beyond routing like for reachability analysis:
 Reachability analysis across an entire country
 Make sure you follow our twitter or blog posts. For example we recently released version 3.0.

It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

 I am looking for a self hosted project management software to use for a non-profit hospital. It should support Kanban boards and maybe even some Scrum, Burndown- & Gantt Charts.
 What I tried:
 - JIRA Software: Got a free community license but the terminology is too software focused
 - JIRA Core: Neutral terminology but no Kanban boards
 - Taiga.io: Looks awesome and our first test server was set up quickly but horrible to set up for configuration with HTTPS and so on. We can't get the mail settings or the LDAP sync to work and the documentation is clearly from coders for coders (a lot of knowledge is assumed).

 The canonical solution that seems to be supported by pretty much everyone is to have an LDAP server (OpenLDAP) and plugin everything to that server (Nextcloud users, Authelia for SSO/resource gating, Keycloak if you're feeling fancy and so on).
 That still leaves some services (e.g. Plex) with their own proprietary accounts (can't really work around that).
 Unfortunately, setting up and managing OpenLDAP is a pain, and it does way more than necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got myself a Synology NAS and got into selfhosting. So im relatively new to all of this and making use of guides to get it working.
 One of the things I wanted to selfhost was a RSS feed which I found in FreshRSS. So I searched online for a guide on how to install this on my NAS and found this guide: https://mariushosting.com/how-to-install-freshrss-on-your-synology-nas/
 This guide explains really well how to install FreshRSS into docker but it ends there.
 So far so good followed the guide and got everything to work, installed the FeedMe app on my android phone and got my own RSS feed. Only to find out that it does not automatically refresh my feed. I have to push the actualize button myself everytime which is obviously not what I want to do. Ideally I want it to automatically refresh every X minutes.
 So the beginner I am tried searching for solutions, which I found but got none to work. On the FreshRSS website it self it states I have to do something with the ./app/actualize_script.php but the fun thing is with the guide I used mentioned above I got none of those things. Don't have the app folder nor have I the script they are talking about. The only folders I have are crontabs, keys, log, nginx, php and www. And inside those folders there is also nothing to find they are talking about.
 So for a summary I have FreshRSS running atm in a docker container on my Synology NAS which is working but only need a solution for how to automatically refresh my feed every X minutes or so.
 Does some of you have experience with this and can help a starting self hoster out?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: Not Refresh but FreshRSS thanks!

Are these features not implemented yet?
 If those are Pinry limitations, what do you fellow self-hosters use that handles at least videos? TBH, I don't really care about websites, but it would be a nice addition.

 The solution normally would be to use some sort of VPN (OpenVPN, WireGuard, ZeroTier, etc) to connect the VPS host to the home network. 
 How is it done from inside a docker container to a home network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there. I am relatively new to the home server scene, but I've quickly begun hosting several services on mine. A personal website via nginx, Pi Hole, Home Assistant, Vaultwarden, etc. - all of these have helpful web interfaces that want to display on ports 80/443 by default. I've been skittish on setting some of these up, for fear of disrupting what I already have working, and I'm curious about what people recommend as the best solution. There are some solutions I've been investigating - having each service use its own arbitrary port, or I think it's possible to manage everything via nginx (I see the word 'reverse proxy' thrown around, but I have no idea if the nginx settings I've been fiddling with is that). I would like to see what people here suggest. Thanks.

 I never got to the point of noting all these details down with pen and paper, as some friends of mine were doing for years, however, I was keen to find a web or app-based solution that came also with all the bells and whistles in terms of data visualization, maps, and the like.
 I found out about FlightMemory, but, as you will understand, I was not exactly thrilled by its looks. A good one I have been using is myFlightradar24, particularly when it comes to its map view, however, I was looking to see if there was a self-hosted one or even a excel template to get the options to play with your flight data and perhaps customise the periods of time you wish to look at and create infographics.

Vuepress seems really complicated for my usage.I am currently using wiki.js but I am not quite happy with it. To make the navigation easy it's to hard at my eyes for the users. Grav on the other side looks also quite complicated...
 I really need a simple wiki structure but with a smooth design do you guys know any other Wiki/Docs software I could use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using a 3rd party service to schedule my (MySQL) database backups, it runs a mysqldump at a specified interval and stores the copy on a remote storage service (eg. Backblaze B2).
 I am looking to replace this service with a self-hosted solution/script, it should do the following:
  
Be able to run a db export command (eg. mysqldump) at a specified time interval, probably using a cron job
 Upload the local backup to a remote storage (AWS, B2, etc.)
 Send alerts/notifications if a backup fails
  
My initial idea was to create a script that does all the above things, and simply run that script as a cron job on the server of the database itself. I know this is not ideal, as if that server goes down the fail notifications won't work anymore. To solve this, maybe just use a separate server to log the backup successes, and that server could handle notifications if a success wasn't received in a specified amount of time.
 ​
 Do you know of any self-hosted apps/scripts that do this? If not, I will try writing one myself as the implementation should be pretty easy.

 As the title says, I currently have a Node 804 case currently hosting a Ryzen 3600, ASRock AM4/X570M, 4 8TB SATA hard drives and a 1660 super for all of my transcoding needs.
 I'd like to replace this case with something that can be rack mounted, I don't know a whole lot about server cases so I thought I'd ask those more knowledgeable.
 Ideally I'd like to have quite a few more drives in the case whilst still having support and enough room for the GPU. Is a SAS/SATA backplane possible? Can anyone think of a case that might work?
 Thanks!

 just evaluating a start page.
 Here https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#personal-dashboards I've seen there is a collection of tools for doing this, can you tell me your experiences with them and which satisfy better my requirements without have to test all of them :)?
 I'm interested in the following aspects:
  
easy to install: docker, pulling a single image of course is better of a docker compose file
 easy to config: I prefer no config file but a user interface with Add botton for services and group of services
 lightweight
 stable, well maintained
 responsive
 user interface: icon + text for each service; the page should be "dense" of contents, to see at glance a lot of services ( I mean, no too wasted spaces)
  
Actually I'm using Heimdall but I have not understood why "link tiles" are not alphabetically ordered, they are chronologically ordered. I read about Homer but it seems it does not satisfy requirement 2; also seen Organizr but is too complex.
 ​
 Thx as usual!!!

 I looking for self-hosted email server where:
 - I can automate create new e-mails and delete old/unused e-mails (built in feature or API)
 - I can set limits for sent messages per mail address.
 - Works on Linux
 - OpenSource (or really good free plan :D )
 Do you know any product that would meet these requirements?

 I've been lurking here for quite a while and I'm beginning to pick up quite a few things about selfhosting - thanks for the helpful guides! I'm wondering if I can use a docker container to host a touchscreen-optimized Firefox VNC which my mother can use on her iPad 2 to get a better web browsing experience (read: doesn't crash when loading cnn.com). I've looked into RemoteApp on Windows, but as I don't have any licenses, I can't really make that happen. Help would be very much appreciated.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog post from James Reynolds, delves into using Fedora CoreOS, Portainer, and WordPress in 7 easy steps. The magic of Fedora CoreOS is that it configures itself at install time, including installing Portainer and enabling the host firewall. Once configured, you can quickly and repeatedly set up this server without logging into it. Then you can use Portainer to run any container or docker-compose file like WordPress. By firewalling Portainer you protect your admin interface from possible attacks while leaving the services rendered by your other containers accessible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not usually the tinfoil hat type but targeted ads are really starting to rub me the wrong way. This post (instagram link FYI) in particular rang alarm bells in my head this morning.
 Ive been meaning to trial hosting a PiHole instance on my Unraid server at home for the last few months and I think I just got the push I needed to take the plunge and give it a shot. From what I understand (I've done 0 reading of documentation so far) you host it, set up your preferences and then point all your devices to it as a DNS. I assume I could just set that on my Router and it would auto push that setting to all my devices inside my LAN through DHCP at the point of next timeout, or just clear the table and let it do its thing.
 My question is that assuming all the above is correct, if not a little oversimplified, I could probably also tunnel all my devices that are outside of my LAN through Wireguard and route them through my home internet connection as well, thereby benefiting from PiHole while outside of my LAN, right? Has anyone else attempted a similar thing? My home internet connection isn't blazing fast but it doesn't have a data cap. If this is something thats doable I would seriously consider upgrading my connection if it required it.
 Side note: I also realize that PiHole isn't some magic bullet that stops all this tracking garbage in its tracks but it can significantly reduce how many ads make it to my screens which is a step forwards for me.

If it helps - I also work in software. I'm not a developer, but I do have a basic understanding of how things are supposed to work.

 Any idea where I could find something like that, preferably that I can install using docker ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. 
 I currently have an 8GB Raspberry Pi running OpenMediaVault and an 8TB external hard drive set up with most of my data on it (mostly just random files). I initially started this as a hobby, but I've found myself getting more into it, and using OMV on a practical level. I have some docker containers set up (nextcloud, nginx, home assistant, adguard, and a few others). I run regular backups of my phone and PC, and am looking into the possibility of backup up all of my photos there too (thanks Google).
 I want to add more storage and at least one other drive for backup/redundancy. Before I start spending money and building out, I wanted some thoughts opinions on how to go about this...
 I'm currently satisfied with the Raspberry Pi running OMV, is there any need to buy a full NAS? What are your thoughts about just buying a 4-bay external hard drive enclosure and adding drives? The 8TB I currently have is an external drive from Costco. Can I just get away with buying another one of those? If I get a multi-bay external enclosure, could upgrade to a more powerful server in the future?
 I'm stuck at the moment, as I don't know which way is the best to go. I'm looking for best bang for the buck while keep some flexibility to upgrade (storage and performance) in the future. 
 Sorry for my scattered thoughts. Any help, feedback, suggestions, etc would be extremely helpful. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm completely new to this and was following along an online book "Obey the Testing Goat" setting up a server using Nginx, Gunicorn, and Django to host on the Pi. I got it working well using my domain name I purchased from GoDaddy for a buck, but I wanted to try and make it so it's accessible more than locally.
 I learned a tiny bit about Dynamic DNS and heard DDclient + CloudFare is a good option to go with. If I understand this right, which I probably don't, then I need to add a CNAME record on GoDaddy which routes to CloudFare. From CloudFare, I need a couple A records which point to my Pi's public IP, which is not static, so DDclient updates it continually.
 How do I set this up? How do I know what CNAME record I need to add to GoDaddy, or am I doing it wrong altogether?
 Currently, going to my domain gives me an error -
  
"Error 1002: DNS points to local or disallowed IP" 
  
Which according to Google, a DNS record points to CloudFares servers and I need to update my A-records. Not entirely sure what to make of this. I'm fairly certain I need to update my CName on GoDaddy but I really don't know what to update it to.
 On a sidenote, I'm not entirely sure my DDclient is working properly either and need to update the conf file, but unfortunately I do not have access to it at the moment or the logs it gives me.

 This works really well for just home use, but I would like to build a better server to accomodate for more ppl. Specifically my question is, and this is assuming my bandwidth is high enough to do all of this: 
  
Is there a good way to figure out what specs I need for lets say 4-5 concurrent streams (maybe x265, so hw decoding?) 
 If I would build a PC to do this, I would still aim for low idle power usage (4-5 streams is probably peak), and for 80% the server will be quite unused.
 How do I do this raid thing in a normal PC and how do I assert other than having an offsite backup that I have data redundancy for my seafile clients
  
Any resource is helpful thanks

Trying to make this as easy as possible, vs having to manually move comments or tweets or whatever other method over, then get it all into some randomizer. I will absolutely do that if there's nothing else, but looking for any self hosted, open source options, or ideas you all may have of a good way to automate this. 
 It's my first go round with a give away, but I'm excited about doing it. At the same time I'm nervous about it, and want it to be as fair as possible.
 I'm looking to simply get an email address, and whether the person needs the 120 V or 240 V kit I'm giving away. Once winners have been chosen, I'll contact them via the email to get shipping info, etc.
 I figured I could do it on my RocketChat system with a special channel, but wasn't sure how to get the user info into a useable tool to randomly select the person. Maybe there's a plugin for it that I haven't found yet. 
 Any ideas or suggestions are much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I feel like I am very close to getting things running, but I have a couple of issues. When I go to my domains section of mailcow admin and click DNS, this is the information in the modal:
 https://i.imgur.com/1UJLY5l.png
 So issue #1 is that I think the server is expecting/listening for the the wrong public IP. I have tried to look everywhere to change this setting, but I failed 😞. Does this mismatch matter? If so where do I change/hardcode this?
 Issue #2 is smaller, but I can't figure out how to make the TSLA certificate be "Connection refused" instead of the actual hash of the certificate... 
 Also ports 80 and 443 for my mail.domain.tld go to a reverse proxy server and then to mailcow, whereas the mail ports go to mailcow directly from the router. My inbound and outbound port 25 is blocked by ISP. With the port checking tool, I am able to verify that all other mail ports on my public IP are listening. 
 The TSLA issue I guess is an optional setting, but I think the mismatch in the IPs are not allowing the mail server to listen properly, resulting in bounces: 
 https://i.imgur.com/EYx5Usc.png
 Not sure if the PTR record matters all too much either, if it does I can see about getting it modified. For the record, I'll probably be sending out through a relay, but I need to be able to receive on my own. If not, are there good options that can forward all mail to me?
 I also have a VPS which I guess I can tunnel to and set up all my DNS records to go there. If I forward all the mail ports from the VPS to mailcow, would that work? Man, I'm not looking forward to getting the iptables setup for dockerized mailcow to use a wireguard interface for wan. But I guess I saw the iptables config in some file so I could potentially just modify that. I don't know, I rather go through my public IP route...

 I recently started running Gitea in Docker and would like to use it to manage and modify my Wordpress files and Docker-compose yml files. I have around 40 docker images running on my QNAP (NAS).
 is this possible?
 Furthermore, it would be absolutely great if, Jenkins recognizes those changes and releases the docker image with it. to save time
 is this (functionality) possible? Unfortunately I can't find much documentation about it.
 ​
 my situation:
 At the moment I edit my docker-compose files manuelly via Notepad++ and with 'docker-compose up' I bring them up in the air. but then I have no version control and I have to manually deploy the relevant image every time.

 just wanna summerize here my experiences related with the object of the topic. This is a sort of organized recap of my previous thread, read it for more info and details. Really thanks to all of those users that wrote there, helping me a lot and doing the big part of the job.
 So, the question is: you some selfhosted services on your own lan and they or you need to use https protocol, or similar ones, and therefore you have to use some sort of certificates, avoiding the self signed ones because browser do not like them. You also want to reduce the effort in the management of this problem, automating all that is possible.
 SOLUTION 1:
 You can install and configure your own PKI+CA, release certificates etc... but this approach causes you need to import your root CA certificat…]]></summary>

 They'll start off playing on Android tablets (Bedrock Edition), and possibly also on the Nintendo Switch.

 Does this exist, or am I going to have to make it myself (e.g. using React with one of the text editing libraries)?

 I am using Syncthing for all my files management across my devices and I am currently using my big-fat-old computer in order to store big files, using an old 1 terrabyte HDD in order to store medias I rarely use but want to keep (ig photos and some music).
 Is it a good idea to zip the files ? How do you access your datas and is there more elegant ways to navigate my photos over the file manager ? And finally, what are the alternatives to google photos for A.I. ? 
 If there is a good one that works locally it would be super nice :D
 ​
 Sorry if the questions are too much 'trivial'.
 Have a pleasant day :)

 Closest I could come to that does what I want is afterlogic, but its a paid service and I don't think its open source.
 Edit: afterlogic is open source, so that is good. And they do have a free lite version, but no calendar/carddav support in the lite version. The paid version would be okay, but updates are only supported on a per year basis, so after a year you need to buy it again for any updates.

So I'm coming to you guys to see if this is something you've seen before or would be interested in. It would be self-hosted, I would not provide any hosting whatsoever since I would have access to the access key and the secret key the AWS provides, so there'd be no trust that I would be able to provide on my side. However, if somebody has already done this, I would be interested in reviewing the code for it. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m thinking of building a new server for my increasing needs, below are the services I’m hoping to host on the new server. This server does not need to fit into a rack but will be on 24/7.
  
Nextcloud (Family use so under 5 users, but used for file backups and sync)
 PhotoPrism (Family use so under 5 users, but used for image backups and sync)
 Jellyfin (Family use so under 5 users, but almost never streaming at the same time)
 Custom apps (Apps that I make, almost no resource use, just things that need to be run on an always on server)
 Plus a little room to expand in case I want to host something new
  
Here is a link to what I’m thinking of getting on PC part picker: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/CcY3p2
 Nextcloud says it needs ~ 8 GB of ram and ~ 6 cores for 25 users so I expect to be using ~ 4 GB ram and ~ 3 cores. PhotoPrism says it needs ~ 4 GB of ram and ~ 2 cores but also says “Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should match the number of cores. ” Jellyfin has people saying it works fine with ~2 GB of ram and I expect it to use less than 2 cores And my custom apps should use way less than 2 GB of ram and less than 2 cores
 I didn’t think I needed a graphics card as 1) they are incredibly high in price rn and 2) I didn’t think any of my hosted apps would take advantage of it. Do you see a problem with this?
 Also, I’m having a problem choosing my storage. I want fast storage but with my budget (Preferably less than $700) and my internet connection (Around 100 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up), I’m not sure that I would see a difference between an HDD vs M.2 SSD. Do you have any recommendations on this?
 As a side note, I have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse laying around that I can use for this build, and am planning on putting a Linux distro on it.
 Do you see any problems with my build? Thanks for all of the help in advance!

 I'm currently writing a backup script. I have several services which are run via docker-compose. My basic idea was to stop all of them -> backing up the compose files, config + volumes and then restart. But how can I do that? 
 The idea was to use labels for the containers to know which should be backed up. I can get them without a problem via bash. After that I just wanted to start them again. But how do I do that? A simple docker start "container" is not enough because this would not start other containers which are the base for some services. So I have to use docker-compose up -d to start them again. But for this I need to get the path to the docker-compose file. But I only have the id of the container.
 Any ideas?

 I’ve been bit with the privacy bug and decided to self host my business files. So I went ahead and acquired a NUC so that I can run Nextcloud and connect to it via VPN when I’m not at home. 
 The thing is I’m reasonably tech savvy but completely useless when it comes to command line and Linux. I intended for this to be a quick operation to setup so I can get back to work- but man was I wrong. I have no clue what’s going on to the point where following the wikis I get lost. (I.e. ignition file for CoreOS). 
 Can someone just point me in the right direction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title basically. I managed my reverse proxy configuration like any other web server. When I deploy a new service, I add the subdomain to my configuration file in nginx and restart the server afterwards. I also apply my SSL cert through this. 
 NPM seems easier to manage and it looks like I can basically re-use my entries for each subdomain in the advanced settings that lets you apply your own settings instead of ticking checkboxes. Thoughts? Send it? Don't do it?

Currently it is running Kubernetes (K3s) and MPI, but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with PVM as a clustering solution. In theory, it seems like it'd be easier to manage than mpiexec'ing every command, but I'm quite new to all this, so it may not be. Once I get K3s fully up n runnin it may prove things to be simpler than I'm expecting.
 So yeah, whataya think¿ I've done a wee bit of research on PVM and there's not a ton out there, am I just lookin in the wrong place¿ Is PVM horribly outdated (the website certainly was lmao)¿ Thanks¡

I am in need of an alternative to google photos that can run on a PC that I have running that I also use for Plex. My main purpose of this is mainly to share photos with family and friends. My girlfriend is an amateur photographer and needs something similar to google photos for sharing to clients. I am hopeful to find a program that can run in windows 10 similar to Plex as it would be easiest in my current setup. Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm running wireguard using the linuxserver/wireguard docker image.
 I managed to get the connection working between containers on two different host.
 Here's what's going on:
 Host A > container A > Network < container B < Host B
 I got the bold areas to connect (i.e. wg container on host A can ping wg container on host B, but cannot reach the host)
 `docker exec` into the container and ping the other host: ok
 ssh into host and ping the other host: not reachable
 What can we do with the docker container config or wg config to allows host A to ping host B?
 I would like to keep all changes made within the computer instead of on the host itself it at all possible. Perhaps some volume mounts or something?
 Only if there is really really no way to do this without modifying host files, will I consider doing so.
 Any help appreciated!

 I want to create multiple "sections" and allow users to upload content (PDF, images etc) in a section, via their browser.
 The user should not register or be required to create a new account. I should password protect each section and anybody who has the credentials should be able to upload in that section. 
 The end result would be me giving a link+credentials to a person/group. Everybody who has the link+credentials should be able to upload anything on my server, in that specific section, via that URL.
 S3 integration would be highly appreciated. 
 Any hints?
 Thank you!

 We are currently using Tallyfy which is a great tool but it’s too expensive for our usage. 
 https://tallyfy.com
 We use it when we need to onboard or offboard employees to make sure everyone in the team is doing their part of the job. 
 It’s a really nice tool, far from the scary workflow management tools I have seen elsewhere. 
 Do you have any idea about something similar which could be self hosted ?

Windows and Mac both have speech recognition built-in; surely there is something out there that lets me take an audio file and get the resulting text from it without going through Google cloud or something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently leased a VPS to host a few services, and took the first steps towards locking down the server (Ubuntu Server 20.04).
 What I have done so far:
  
Update & Upgrade the system
 Install / enable unattended-upgrades & apt-listchanges (automatically install important updates daily, and monitor/list changes automatically)
 Create a non-root user, add to sudoers
 Lock down SSH 
 Change to a nonstandard port
 Create & configure key based SSH login (key protected with password)
 Disable root login via SSH
 Disable password login via SSH
 
 Configure Firewall 
 Create rule to allow but limit SSH in on new port
 Create rules to allow in, on other necessary ports (for me just 80 and 443)
 Set default deny for everything else.
 Rule to drop ping requests
 Enable firewall
 
 Setup fail2ban for SSH 
 Rather relaxed 15/15/15 rule (15 failed logins, in 15 minutes = 15 minute ban)
 
 Check to make sure apparmor is enabled and in enforcement mode
  
​
 On the to-do / research list are (1) setting up mail so important system mail is sent (or forwarded from 'root') to my actual e-mail address (2) figuring out backups of some sort
 ​
 What additional steps would you take?
 What have I left out / forgotten / got wrong?

 Has anyone done this? Can I take a peek at your config? I'm totally at loss here. I've been googling for days :D
 I'm suspecting I have to do some custom nginx config for Taiga, but none of the stuff I have tried so far has worked. I'm not all that sure how I should get those VIRTUAL_HOST and LETSENCRYPT_HOST environment variables across to nginx-proxy either.

I'm essentially following JDM_WAAAT's NAS killer 5.0 guide and just want to know how it still holds up, or if there are better options since it is a year old. Usage will be primarily Plex/Sonarr/Radarr/Jackett/qBittorrent with one local client and possibly ~2 remote streams. I plan on getting into unRaid/Docker and exploring additional projects. I've never built a computer before so any feedback/resources/advice would be appreciated.
 CPU: i7-5775C or i7-4790 (whichever I can get for <$150/$200)
 Motherboard: Asus z97-A
 Ram: 4x8gb whatever is compatible/cheap
 Cache: 1tb ssd
 Array: 7x6tb WD Reds
 Case: CoolerMaster n400
 Miscellaneous: power supply, fans, cpu cooler, SATA cables, SATA power cables, thermal paste
 This is the general idea, but is there anything I'm forgetting overlooking? Any concerns/bottleneck/connection issues I should be aware of? I want to spend under $2k all in.

 I've got Paperless-ng up and running in Docker and even though there were some bumps, the experience really helped me to learn about how Docker works. Before Paperless-ng, I created a bash script to do the scanning and OCR for me (props to OCRmyPDF, it works great), but I didn't have any learning or tagging system. So far it seems to work well, but I wanted to hear about other document management systems and their various strengths and weaknesses. Does one work better at invoices or does another seem to hang up on certain languages?

It timesout any way to access it , I am noobie in this but note that my router ip and public ip are different as I believe its from router within router so I know portforwarding doesnt work . Is there anyway to portforward in secure and private way as I know there are sites like portmap.io but need best privacy respecting now ? Also is it just different issue that I cant access outside pi on same network

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I am in the process of building a home server, and wanted to know if anyone knew any cool webscraping projects they've deployed.
 For some reason, the idea to reach out and ping different internet servers for information or to gather data, etc, sounds like a ton of fun. Its just an ocean of servers, and there's gotta be some cool stuff to find (FTP, directories, etc).
 Any projects involving Archive.org , Wayback Machine, etc would be super cool too.
 Or if you guys have any previous webscraper or webcrawler projects you'd like to share for reference, I'm all ears. I ask because I used to be super into this to make Twitter bots that did this, and wanted to get back into this but more so for my personal website, and for my home server too.
 ​
 Thanks as always!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've gone the gambit of trying to debate how to go about this, but wanted your take on this to see if there is anything decent to do some bird watching.
 Are there any decent, easily deployable, bird watching projects to do secure streams of an outside bird feeder?
 This sounds really dumb, but the one great thing about working from home sometimes is that one of the bird feeders gets swarmed with some really cool looking birds (we're talking cardinals, blue jays, etc) and I would love it if I could deploy a decent webcam that could do motion capture for this kind of thing.
 I would deploy it on a site too if its secure as well, but wanted it to be a bit hacker proof in that I don't want anyone to be able to just control the camera. 
 I kind of was thinking to have something that would be able to just record previously recorded video which I could then dump onto a video file on my site later, so it would stream initially on LAN, and then be dumped to a file on my site for public viewing later.
 Any ideas?
 ​
 I'm open to getting a Pi (Zero, 3, 4, etc) with related power banks. Its just the idea of how to power it over a whole week is what has kept me from actually doing it.
 ​
 Thanks as always!

 so currently i am looking for parts for a new homeserver build for my VMs.
 So my plan for 24/7 running VMs is:
  
2-3x Win 10 VMs with light workloads (1-2 core, 4-6gb Ram each)
 2x Linux VMs (Plex and Nextcloud) (1 core, 2-4gb Ram each)
 as well as some Linux VMs for testing Stuff (1 core, 1-2gb Ram each)
  
As Os i was planing to go with ProxMox, budget is around 800€ without any Storage or GPUs but adjustable. Further i had the idea to maybe convert the server to a cloud gaming host later on (2 gaming VMs with a GPU passed through each) bc of that the server should have plenty of PCiE Slots. Pls also consider the long therm costs (power usage), also i dont care if normal pc case or rack. 
 My first Idea was to build the server:

Specifically, porn clips and photos. I have a bucket of video clips from various tube sites that I’ve saved with almost no tagging and metadata, and with fairly generic titles that don’t include any details on the performer/actress/etc. 
 I also have a lot of properly named full videos from torrents, etc, that have performers/dates/company/etc. Those should be easy to organize in something like Stash, etc. 
 This may be harder for videos, I understand. But for photos, is there something like this, but self-hosted? Like will it recognize things like blonde, brunette, etc?
 I have a newer Synology along with a few Linux boxes (i5 4th Gen, etc) and I’m familiar enough with Docker. Does what I’m looking for exist?

 However I am very concerned with the security of my bucket. It isn't public, I am using an IAM policy to control access to the data on it. However I am aware that a few years ago there were several major data breaches at companies which relied on S3 Buckets. Reading up on this they seem to have been caused by user misconfiguration, but there was at least one instance where hackers were able to access the IAM credentials thru Server Side Request Forgery. 
 My set up isn't nearly as complex as it was for these large corporations - should I be concerned? Is an IAM policy enough or is there something else I can do to secure my data? I know that nextcloud already has a feature that lets you encrypt data , is that enough?
 Also, what storage provider do you guys prefer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble making Photoprism automatically start with windows. I know the command is docker run --restart=always however I cant figure out what to put after that. Simply putting photoprism afterwards said the container could not be found. I tried docker run --restart=always photoprism/photoprism which seemed to work, but then started something called flamboyant_neumann with the name photoprism, not the actual photoprism docker (see photo)
 What command should I use? I have the container ID number but Idk what the name would be.
 P.S. I'm using Windows because I am trained in Batch and Powershell. I know its worse, but Im more comfortable with it for my own home server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have an Intel NUC. I'd like to use it to deploy a lot of self-hosted apps, both from open source as well as my own server application. For example, I'd like to set up a sourcegraph server so I can search over some of my repositories easily, and other kinds of servers and databases too (elasticsearch, kibana, redis, influxdb, prometheus, postgresql, maybe a docker registry or something) to get more experience and exposure.
 I'm struggling with some of the basics about starting, running, and deploying self-hosted apps. For example:
  
How do I keep my apps running all the time, even if 
 If my Intel NUC gets shut down (like, after a reboot), how do I get all the applications I was running back up again, ideally with zero fuss?
 How do I make sure all the apps I want keep running?
 How do I deploy changes to the apps? Ideally I could do this from my macbook which I use for development, and again with as little fuss as possible. In the best case, I can push a change to my GitHub repo, have a jenkins server running on my NUC run CI/CD tests, then deploy to the NUC.
 Do y'all run Docker or Kubernetes or something to run lots of apps at once?
 Also, is there a chat room or something where I can ask questions in low-latency? Like a slack or discord room you would suggest? (I haven't used IRC yet, so I'd prefer to stick to Slack or Discord).
  
Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know, the point of self-hosting is to self-host. I just don't really wanna spin up a server with 1TB of storage. Anyway, looking for some storage providers which support Borg repositories. BorgBase and Hetzner look attractive. Rsync.net is cheap and Hetzner is who hosts my VPS, so, it would make sense to spin up a Storage Box in the same place as my VPS (free internal traffic). Problem with these storage providers is that I'd need it to be on my VPN (WireGuard). I know they give a public IPv4 address so I could forward that in my DNS, but, I'd prefer it if it were on my VPN and private. I can't decide between Rsync.net and Hetzner; what's your experience with either one?
 ​
 Further on from that, I'm sure there are some other providers which no one knows about, those ones are usually the best. Any alternative providers you know?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have previously deployed wireguard using the linuxserver/wireguard docker image, and it was easy to set up with the objective of reaching my home server while away.
 Now, I'm looking to set up a vpn to connect some servers in the cloud into a subnet, without actually using the main wg server as a gateway (to avoid pinging traffic back and forth) - what I'm looking to achieve is to have different server computers accessible via a VPN network only, without proxying the traffic (ie clients use their respective gateways). Is this possible with wg? How should I set this up?
 I'm unsure as to how to set this up using docker. Nor do I have much experience with the 'ip' or networking packages. How would one set this up using docker? What prerequisite knowledge is important for a successful implementation here?
 I have read the official docs but was not able to see how to achieve the gateway criteria, and also did not have full understanding of the underlying 'ip' commands. Happy to get pointed to the right resources to achieve this.

 There's a somewhat popular forum I'm on that is sorta at the point where it will fly apart(and managment has taken the "I can do what I want with my 100k user forum, even if that means changing what its based on and about, go build your own"stance) but a decent chunk of the users have dial up like internet speeds. As a result, we are looking for something very light.
 Why not use the same software that that forum is using? Because it hasn't recieved any updates since 2011 and its recommended OS Windows server 2003.
 I have the internet capabilities, along with a pile of hardware sitting around and the others have knowledge in running and self hosting sites, but we can't seem to find something light to run, or something that light.
 Please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask, but it seemed like it was worth a shot to ask here.

 If you used another note's name in the text of your note it would automatically hyperlink to it wiki-style. You could also create a new note from text in your current note and that text would always hyperlink to that note. You could also have aliases so various versions of text would link to the same note. 
 At least this is what I remember about it, but for the life of me I can't find it again now. It was on a linux machine, but I think it might have had a poor windows port at the time. 
 Is there something similar, which would maybe allow the creation of stuff like mind maps, indexes, collate the notes into books, etc., but which can be hosted as a web app? I've looked at a number of apps in the awesome selfhosted list, but, at least from the descriptions, none seem to fit the bill. Tidlywiki seems to come close, but I'm not so sure from what I've tried of it so far.
 PS. Ideally it should allow for easy upload of images, preferably in-line pasting of screenshots.

 I am looking for a monitoring solution running on probably one of my raspberry pies. It would be great if it can send an email in case of a host down and maybe temp is getting to high. Services and not hosts only and maybe a dashboard would be nice. At work we have Icinga but not sure if that is a bit overkill for my 5 raspberries. 
 Any idea of a cool docker Container solution for me?

 NVR software to monitor/record cameras seems pretty basic but of all the options, none are easy or good, I'd say.
 Ignoring all the windows only crap for obvious reasons
 Zoneminder: Extremely difficult to set up, even in docker, and once you do get it set up it's ugly as sin and hard to put on a different port.
 Shinobi: The "best" option but the dev is apparently a huge dick, their documentation is laughable, the UI is bad and again, very difficult to dockerize.
 Kerberos.io: Sounded great, easy to use docker, nice UI, ONE CAMERA PER DOCKER INSTANCE. Seems to be intentional to drive people toward their enterprise (paid) option.
 Unifi-video: Before it was killed, it was a ubiquiti product (avoid, awful support now, unfortunately), and very difficult to host or dockerize reasonably, especially if you want to use SSL or GOD FORBID put it behind a reverse proxy.

 For those unfamiliar, Netmaker is a platform for creating dynamic virtual networks using WireGuard. It takes machines running in different locations (home, office, cloud, data center), and puts them into a single flat network where they can talk to each other dynamically and securely.
 Here's the major update: External Clients

 I've got an i5 NUC with 16GB RAM. Running ESXI currently, hosting a Windows Server instance that runs some custom software (twitter bots etc) and then 3x Ubuntu VMs (UniFi Controller, Home Assistant, Pi-Hole).
 Wondering if I'm making the most efficient use of my NUC? I mean, I figure I'm probably not but I'm not entirely sure what the best way forward is.
 I see I can run Docker on Windows... I'm assuming it'd host all my above services?

 Are there any unofficial package repo for sourcehut for Ubuntu or are there any alternatives with a simple interfacte?

I started to use Google photo to store unlimited pictures so I thought if Google have all of my pictures and data about me let it be useful and use it everywhere. Since Google photo is not unlimited anymore I want to self host my own stuff like a pi hole, a Nas, a domotic assistant, a node express test server etc. 
 So my question for you is, where to start. I see that a lot of you are hosting many things. Are you using one or many raspberry pi, are you using more powerful . I want to be able to add a "module"(self hosted server) one by one without breaking everything, so I can make the transition smoother.
 Note that I don't want to get rid of Google but I don't want to depend on it 
 Sorry if someone already explained it on a post, thanks you for helping me.

 I'm building a solution for a client. They like the look of NextCloud but I'm concerned about stories I've heard about poor performance. They will primarily be using it to catalogue large amounts of photo and video files (10-20TB).
 Main features are photo & video galleries, project/group based permissions, text chat, simple task management, and calendaring. NextCloud seems like a great fit for this but interested if anyone has any other suggestions which I could investigate as possible options?
 Many thanks, Adam.

I have NPM running in a Docker container via OMV and have a dozen or so subdomains working for all the different Docker containers. They all point nicely to different services running on different ports on the server and I'm very happy with how smoothly it's been going creating new Let's Encrypt certs and whatever.
 What I'm trying to do now is use the domain that I own to create a subdomain that points to a Docker container NOT on that same server. To be specific, I have a Linode server that's running something I want to be able to access at a subdomain that I own. I setup NPM on that Linode Docker in hopes that I could tie my domain.com to that as well and assign subdomains on that server but it's not working and I assume it's because I am already using that domain in the NPM container running on my home server. 
 ​
 Currently:
 subdomain1.domain.com points to 192.168.1.100:1234
 subdomain2.domain.com points to 192.168.1.200:1235
 and so on, and so on.

 I would like to add:
 subdomain3.domain.com points to 75.65.55.45:1234

 I am in the early stages of setting up a business and am looking to shed some costs off our expenses and run our own VoIP server. We run everything else ourselves including web services, mail services, file storage services etc, however looking at moving to our own phone system.
 I am a server administrator by trade so have a good knowledge of this sort of stuff, however when it comes to VoIP, my knowledge is very limited.
 What is needed to set up a VoIP server? Is it worth it?
 I assume I will need to configure the server itself, and purchase a number - how is routing handled? What other things will I need to consider? It will be running on a dedicated server hosted by OVH
 Requirements would need to be free/open-sourced or low-cost and maintained. UK numbers, and have the ability to run via a smartphone and/or a desktop PC (softphone)
 If it comes down to it, I will just continue the subscription with Skype
 Any info would be amazing, thank you!
 EDIT: It would be mostly inbound for receiving support calls

 For the moment, I don't like the appearance very much, and I would like it to be a little more customizable (color, text size, ...).
 The application is develop in Golang and available in docker hub.
 The source code is available in Github : https://github.com/Labbs/domo
 A Kanban is available for the features I want to put and I am open to suggestions for improvements.https://github.com/Labbs/domo/projects/1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an excellent subreddit and im glad i found it. I have some questions, i have done some research, but i figured this would be easier.
 I found navidrome a few weeks ago after dealing with constant nightmares with plex and emby. Not only does navidrome work flawlessly, but it's simple. 
 The first question is what is considered the best music server to run in a container on docker? All i really need is artist, albums, genres, playlist, etc. all the basics. Navidrome doesnt have genre as of this moment but i am paired to it via play:sub on ios and it has genres. I am really going to be using navidrome on my phone when i am not home. When i am home i will be using kodi. 
 The next question is about photos and videos stored on my nas. I used to use plex for music and for my photos and videos. They destroyed both music and photos and videos. Alot of the time, the videos would not play. I basically want something how plex worked. That has an app i can open and view my pics and videos fast. Right now i am using jellyfin just for my pics and videos, but it's a bit slow. I want the container to only read pics and videos, with no write access. I saw people recommending photo view which i can not install on docker synology. I also saw photoprism, but figured i would post this to what is the best route to go.
 Any other self hosted container recommendations would be great as well ! 
 Thank you!

 Is there an existing android app that dumps all sensor data somewhere? It would be great if I could be able to pull up a database for keystrokes, gps location, accelerometer, possibly audio but this might require a fair amount of processing and bandwidth.
 Not intended to be some type of clandestine data collection operation. Simply my own way to store phone history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! 
 I recently have been tasked with integrating SMS notifications into a wordpress website to give users updates on their orders and deliveries. 
 As this is a delivery service, texting needs to be relatively immediate to avoid the drivers needing to wait outside the recipient's home. 
 That being said, we are looking to have 2-way conversations using the phone number we've ALREADY established with the clients for the business. So after much research I have found this service: 
 https://bulkgate.com
 They have a great functionality called "Mobile Connect" that allows you to essentially start a server on your phone to handle the sending / receiving of messages and then relay that info back to their server / api. 
 Realistically this is EXACTLY what I need (especially with their WooSMS plugin) however, sometimes the messages can take nearly 10 minutes to arrive. It's random and has no rhyme or reason as to why it takes longer, so it's difficult to debug. 
 I was hoping to discover if a similar service exists or If I can self-host my own gateway like Bulkgate has done to use my cell phone to send messages. 
 I have seen this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gsmmodem but have not gotten it to work and truly this would need a significant amount of development from this point. 
 Anyone have any ideas?

 so if any of you had any similar configs or can point me in the right direction to find my answer I would be very grateful. 
 I configured everything from a docker run command, and then found out you can enable the admin page, and tried from there, but both methods were not successful in sending a test email.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the past while I've been attempting to secure my files the best I can on my server. I know that files and data on enterprise cloud servers are encrypted (or at least I hope they are) and so I've tried to implement this just using GPG. I'm currently hosting my own Nextcloud instance but before that I was using one of the public servers that offer a certain amount of storage for free. I made a habit of removing metadata, compressing and encrypting the files so that I know that only I can access them but this became quite time consuming.
 I decided to setup some shell scripts to automate this for myself and I figured other people who are self-hosting or using a public Nextcloud server might be interested too. I wrote a basic guide on the steps I would go through and how this script can automate it to save time if anyone's interested.
 The Mat2 CLI alone is a great addition as it strips all the metadata from you files and it works recursively so it's fairly simple to use.

This way I could still use their excellent app. OFC I also consider paying for the higher tier, but a self-hosted way seem to be preferable for me. 
 I've seen LibrePhotos mentioned here (https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/npoxm4/librephotos_a_fork_of_ownphotos_with_video_support/) and think that this + GooglePhotos backup script (e.g. https://github.com/JakeWharton/docker-gphotos-sync) could do the trick. 
 I wonder if anyone already has such a setup running or consider to do it?

 I have 5 servers inside a 10.0.0.0/16 private network. And I have Docker Swarm initialized with --advertise-addr 10.0.0.4.
 My main goal here is to configure Traefik v2 within that private network. So, in traefikv2.yml I have this:
 networks: public: driver: overlay attachable: true ipam: config: - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24 
 It's ok to put my private subnet there? Which configuration do I need so Traefik works with that network inside my Swarm, and also listen to any user traffic comming from outside (let's say a website)?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need a way to backup all my Docker containers/volumes (really only the volumes, but the containers as well incase of compatibility issues) to the cloud. They're hosted across three different devices (2x RPi and 1x VPS). Now I'm thinking about it, would probably be useful if I could backup the commands used to start all my various docker containers.
 Duplicati stuck out to me because it looks easy but I've read that restoring a backup is a pain. What's your experience? If it's not been the best, what have you used/do you use instead?
 For some insight, my docker containers have volumes attached to them (/var/lib/docker/volumes/{code-server_data, portainer_data, etc}). All I could do is backup the volumes directory and that can be done with rsync, etc. But, I'd like it to be in a nice GUI which is another reason Duplicati stuck out to me, and the fact that it integrates with Cloud, which is probably where I'd backup to.
 ​
 I could care less about the OS itself - all I'd need to do is reinstall the OS and restore the docker volume backup and off I go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm new to the surveillance env, but I know about the privacy issues related to most of the commercial IP cameras and their softwares.
 I'd like to build a small surveillance system for my house, just a couple of cameras that I can control remotely from an Android phone (and locally from my Linux PC to easily configure and keep an eye on my cameras when I'm home).
 I normally use Docker on my PC and have got a small remote Linux server that I use for small personal projects. Unfortunately I don't have a Raspberry Pi, but I might consider to buy one. 
 What are my options, mainly privacy aware and what cameras should I buy?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I wanted to spend a few months doing some personal testing to make sure everything was running stable. I'm happy to say my household has been using TaskBud for a few months now and it seems to be mostly bug free!
 Link to my project: https://github.com/SteffenBlake/TaskBud/
 What is TaskBud?
 Simply speaking its just a To-Do list app, but meant for multiple users, free to use, open source, and self hosted with support for features like:
  
CRON based repeating tasks
 "Wait Until" functionality
 Mobile First design
 Real Time App with SignalR, so when someone changes something you see the change asap on your screen as well.
 Markdown support
 And now with v1.1.0, basic API hooks for creating tasks! Which means you can use IFTTT or etc to bind your home assistant commands to push Tasks to the To-Do list pretty easily
 And a fair bit more!
  
I might add more API endpoints in the future if there is a demand for it, its not a lot of work but I just wanted to get what is needed for folks to be able to use their home assistants with Taskbud.
 Feel free to try it out!
 Found a bug?
 Report it here! https://github.com/SteffenBlake/TaskBud/issues

 I'm currently using a frankensteined Office PC for my server with an Intel i3-8100, 1 stick of 8GB DDR4-2666, and it's mounted to an Xpeneology running Dell Optiplex 320.
 I'm looking into consolidating into one PC and using Unraid because y'all have definitely kickstarted my addiction to self-hosting (thanks! :) ), but this chip shortage is driving me mad when finding parts to build my PC.
 But, having the capability of running Plex transcoded streams, and many other services in unraid, while also being able to use hot-swap hard drive bays, and have a rack-mount server form factor.
 Any reccomendations? I've been considering getting a used prebuilt and case swapping to a 2u case, but I'm worried that it would cause incompatibility issues when upgrading hardware.
 Any advice would be helpful :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was doing some research on this and couldn't find an IndieWeb solution to help merge and filter content that's coming from many sources.
 I have content that's being added in multiple places in this form:
  
URL
 Title
 Description (optional)
 Tags (optional)
  
It's very unlikely that I'll ever get to 100% self-hosted, but I want all of this content to be aggregated in a self-service solution of some kind. Then I'll be able to do more interesting filtering, reminders, automatic posting, etc.
 It becomes a little bit clearer when you look at the sources:
  
Bookmarks in pinboard.in.
 Instapaper articles.
 Notes to self as Slack messages.
 Chrome bookmarks on work machines.
 Saved Reddit posts.
 Favorites on Hacker News.
 Saved threads on Lobsters (a Reddit-like site)
 Faves on Twitter.
  
A potential solution would be to choose one of the options above, like Pinboard, and push all of the content there. That's fine in theory, but I'd need a tool, or collection of tools to push the content to that location. Pinboard is great, but I'd still have to build some additional functionality for handling automatic posting of specific content.
 It would be much better to have all of this data in the database of a self-hosted app that I can access, or hack on the app itself. It would ideally maintain connectors for all of the sources above and add more. I have yet to find such a tool and wanted to ask here. Ultimately, I think I'll have to just build something for myself.

 And it is no problem if they be several scripts.
 Although i like to know everything possible (every one that is available) 
 I mainly prefer those who can installed on free hostings that mostly support php.
 But i like to know others also.
 Thank you very much.
 Also if you know any way to mirror well knows websites to my own domain or cloudflare (i don't know any technical names but something like cname cloaking or better ways)
 for this leak detection websites (like ipleak, dnsleaktest, whoer and others) say that mirroring way please.
 Why i ask this is because most of these services are blocked by our idiot ISPs to prevent knowing their vulnerabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I am currently managing a small company's infrastructure and we basically have a bunch of docker containers we have to run for each application. This runs out of a single physical machine, and all configuration is done with environment variables when possible.
 The final goal is to save these configurations on a git repository to track any changes, but, how should I organize this?
 My first idea was to create a single docker-compose file, but that quickly became huge to manage. An alternative would be to create smaller docker-compose files for each application, then create a batch script to launch each of them.
 Is there a third option that I am missing? What (and why) do you do in your case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently using Nextcloud for a bunch of things (some files but not many, contacts, notes, calendar, etc) and while it works fine for this, the calendar web interface in particular is way too slow (I'm using Nginx + PHP-FPM on amd64).
 I saw this other thread that mentioned Radicale as an alternative, but Radicale doesn't have a web interface, which is important if I'm on a machine that I don't have a client installed on yet.
 Does anyone know of an alternative to Nextcloud calendar that:
  
Has a fast and responsive web interface
 Supports Caldav for syncing to client devices
 Has an import function so I can import my Nextcloud calendar
  
I don't care about any other features such as contacts or notes, because I'm happy with using Nextcloud for those for now.

 I've been looking into creating a simple documentation site for my team members since my team has grown in size recently. I have tens of dozens of documents, instructions and step-by-step configurations for reference.
 The basic functionality that I'm looking for are for people to login and search for topics, view the documentation, check they've read them. Do you guys know of any such system that I can self-host in my system and share with them? I've been looking at sites like https://docusaurus.io and https://www.bookstackapp.com. 
 Am I in the right track? Or are there better ones for my needs?
 Thank you very much for your time reading this and for any responses.

 Five months ago a thread was posted about LibrePhotos and I got a lot of feature requests. I have been working on LibrePhotos since then. This is a quick update about features that got added since then:
  
Support for videos
 Basic support for RAW images
 It is now possible to find and delete missing photos
 You can now install LibrePhotos locally on Linux
 It is now possible to scan with multiple threads at once
 There is now a "Download selected photos" button
 Images for ARM64 are in testing
 You can view the REST API under /api/swagger

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are working on a project to provide a complete Google Photos alternative. There are 3 main advantages Google Photos provide:
 1- Safe and resilient to data loss
 2- Simple application interface
 3- Flexible storage
 We are working on a decentralized solution, which is indeed opensource. Solution is based on IPFS, IPLS and proxy re-encryption. Files are stored on an IPFS node, which can be synchronized with as many other nodes as user chooses to keep data safe and resilient to loss. Also data can be encrypted and saved safely on filecoin network or any normal cloud server. The node provides file management and database API through IPLD/IPFS. Developers can develop for end-users using simple-to-use APIs that are provided for each node. User can either install the open-source software on a machine manually to create a "BOX" node or purchase a "BOX" node.
 ​
 First application we made is a Google Photo replacement, which you can find here:
 functionland/photos (github.com)
 ​
 you can also read more at our website:
 https://fx.land
 I would appreciate any constructive feedback and stay tuned!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm about to launch a WordPress website that is specific to a growing community in Austin, TX. I want this website to be as fast as possible for users who will be contributing and revising articles.
 I'm torn between using Digital Ocean's NVME droplet which the closest servers are in San Francisco, or Linode which only has SSD, but it's closest location is in Dallas. I also feel that since this is for a specific location in TX, having a TX-based location would be appreciated by users.
 So the question is: Is storage speed faster than server location? 
 I currently have several DO $5 droplets, one of which is running my personal websites. I'm happy with the service which, but that's just for me as I'm the lone admin.
 This new website is a separate venture. I expect several dozen users to be editing the site at the same time, and would like it to be very interactive and as instantaneous as possible. I plan on starting with the lowest tier options and upgrading as needed.
 Both companies offer a $100 credit for the first two months. I've considered launching both to test, but I really don't want to spend that time testing the speed, and would rather spend time with more developing and getting the site ready for it's initial launch.
 Any thoughts on this would be super helpful.

 - Self hosted (obviously).
 - Have a nice iOS app that is not just a web frontend.
 - Can search both in all notes and inside a note.
 - Support categories.
 - It's not for Nextcloud (after some years running it decided I just don't like it).
 Nice to have:
 - Good Android app (I sometimes switch to/from Android to iPhone).
 - Open source.
 - Markdown.
 I see there are a lot of options on the awesome self-hosted list but I'm a lazy bastard and before starting to try them all I just ask here in case somebody knows some app matching these requisites.

 My last OS self hosted project Podgrab was received very well by this community. That project has really matured since I last posted here so I recommend that you give it a look again.
 Today I am announcing my next OS project release - Hammond
 https://github.com/akhilrex/hammond
 It is the logical successor to Clarkson, which is not being developed any more. Here is what all Hammond does
  
Multiple Vehicle management
 Multiple Users support
 Share vehicles across multiple support
 Supports different fuel types, units of measurements and currencies.
 Ability to create quick entries at the gas station/pump which can be entered properly later.
 Mobile Friendly
 Docker support
 No external database required
  
I plan to built this tool with many more features in the future so all kinds of Bug reports and Feature requests are appreciated.

 But there is the oddball exception.
 I was curious to see if anybody here had come across a simple internal service that lets one sign CSRs using an internal CA (more realistically a chained cert that has been signed by an airgapped CA). Or even "pre-generate" a signed cert and key combo for future use. (Getting the trusted certificate loaded onto the devices would be an exercise left to the admin.)
 Essentially, I had been planning on hacking this together using Python and Flask, but I also don't want to reinvent the wheel. Especially if the wheel is already polished, feature complete, and tested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Google thinks some people in US are not in the US, because they also have a personal VPN server at home for their family abroad. Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?
 ​
 DR:
 We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It's very similar to PiVPN.
 About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. 
 For example, YouTube music says "this service is not available in your country" on the person's phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don't think their families were using any of these services, but can't be sure.
 We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it's always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.
 Does Anyone Else face this issue?

 It's a very basic VPS in digitalocean running Ubuntu and in which I was able to self-host my own Nextcloud server via Snap (automatic updates :] ) by following this tutorial.
 Now that I'm already paying every month for the VPS and I've built some momentum around researching about it, I would like to use my single VPS with ubuntu to run other services, such as Wallabag and maybe a personal Wiki, but so far I've been puzzled by the amount of options available to achieve what I intend.
 I heard multiple times terms such as Nginx, Traefik, Docker-Compose, ... and I wonder what would be my best bet.
 All I'm looking is for some privacy, security and ease of use so I can put all my focus on the process and not the tools :)
 I would appreciate if I could get some direction from some you that may have much more experience in self-hosting than I am.
 Thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Im would like to host a website or app that allows to open a public case. And people can anonymously share evidence of that case (pictures, videos, audio, text, etc.) Also that anyone can view but not delete the evidence.
 Example some drunk folk hits and runs killing a child. The case gets to the media but justice isnt served because of corruption or slow process. This way maybe someone has a little piece of evidence that can help (example: some local business has a camera that allows to identify make, model and color of the car, etc.).
 And how can I host it anonymously to keep myself safe.

Due to the fact that I use syncthing for work and home, I started to wonder if it would be possible to integrate syncthing with the calendar (android + three linux device). This is an issue that bothers me terribly, because I would not be in such a situation depends on one main server, and on a network of several computers. I was already thinking about Nextcloud / Owncloud / Radicale but unfortunately they are based on one main hardware and not syncthing on several devices. Personally, I think a decentralized network has more advantages than a centralized computer network structure. That is why I am looking for solutions involving network decentralization, because then I have control over everything working on any computer / laptop. I hope that you will help me find interesting solutions based on a decentralized network. Thanks!

 I'm trying to figure this out for a while and I seem to be out of luck. I am running NPM with Portainer and MailCow mail server. There are lots of exposed ports to the outside (portainer 9000, mailcow UI on ports 83, etc.) and I don't think these need to be published to the outside. Isn't the whole idea of having the proxy manager to have only 80 and 443 ports open and the rest to be accessible only from localhost?
 Anyone has any idea how do I achieve this? 
 I've tried editing the mailcow nginx container and remove the published ports, but the IP won't get assigned and it's not working at all. Any workaround?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

I am not very good with css/html or UI design in general so I am looking for something that has a lot of that already done and I just need to tell it where to put things and tie my python app in to it. Being a programmer I can figure out the JS/api to the library/coponents. Can anyone offer suggestions of web UI frontend with a library of components that can be used out of the box from a design perspective? 
 I think my layout will be kind of similar to VS code (or other IDEs) with a list of files on the left, tabs and code editor. Some status icons at the top(or bottom). I want to use Ace or code mirror for the editor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the NordVPN apps there is a type of connection called Obfuscated Server which is meant to conceal the fact that you're using a VPN from endpoints that you visit. This is the relevant bit from the link:
  
Obfuscated servers are used to bypass VPN-blocking firewalls. To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. 
 VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways. For example, data packets can be hidden using additional SSL/SSH encryption so that all the VPN metadata is out of sight. Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. 
 Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header. This way, it looks like regular HTTPS traffic filled with meaningless information. Firewalls can’t recognize it, so they let it pass.
  
Question is: How can I implement this from my home server?

 ​
 The Wireguard containers are both running and connecting with any issues. 
 I connected the Matrix container to the wireguard clients network and the matrix container has a working internet connection.
 Now for the NGINX portion I am using the jwilder container. The NGINX container is connected to the wireguard servers network. 
 The problem here is that the NGINX does not recognize the Matrix instance and I am wondering where the issue is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there. I'm new to self hosting and have spent the last few days doing some research, however I still have a lot of stuff I couldn't figure out. I figured it's best I mention my use case so here goes:
  
Plex server: I haven't decided on plex as such but seeing as it's the most common, I might start with it. I'm okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I'm only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn't be required, but I've read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I'd like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.
 Smarthome: This is the part that I haven't done any research on so excuse me if something doesn't make sense. From my understanding I'll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I'd like to be able to do this.
 Seedbox: I'm currently seeding about 60TB of "linux iso's". This is spread across 20k torrents. I'd want to move all this to the new server.
 File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.
 Security system: Camera's would output and store locally in this server.
  
This is all I can think of for now but I'm pretty sure I'd need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?
 I'm pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones? I'd ideally want to run all this off a single synology nas but I don't know if that's possible.
 Oh and it's also worth mentioning that I live in a studio apartment so I wouldn't want a noisy server. That pretty much eliminates most Xeons.

It has a red snake that runs around, and depending on CPU and IO load, the length of the snake changes. It's great being able to just briefly glance at a montior from far away, to see how much load my system is going through. Also, if you have more than one CPU core, you can have a different colored snake for the other core. 
 My question is, does such a similar screensaver exist for Linux shells? I remember back in the late 90s, there was a Windows type screensaver for it, but it was really blurry and nowhere as authentic as the original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as the title suggests, I'm looking for a lightweight nextcloud alternative, I used nextcloud but it's not for me. It's just too slow and I just need to access my files and don't need any other knicks and knacks. 
 I have a smb server established but it only works on my network and not outside it, if somehow it works outside that'd be great
 Any suggestions ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello: right now I've got two containers that are running. A seafile container, and a gitlab container. I use nginx on the host system to proxy these, one of these containers (seafile) I installed using docker-compose, the others I have not (gitlab had a longish string for installation you needed to use). I didn't publish the ports, but left them default. When I look at posts I see people using lots of other docker containers to monitor/manage/configure their docker containers, and I'm a bit confused. I will be adding more containers for sure, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I'm using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn't going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?
 I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there's a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I'm not opposed to swapping nameservers.
 I'm sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I've spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along. Any tips/ideas would be welcome. Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, sorry it this isn't the right sub for this kind of question, feel free to direct me to a better suited sub. 
 So, I've tried a few tutorials in the past that go about it, but I've never managed to get it fully working, most that I got is making a apparently working wg tunel between my RPi & the VPS. Then I let it go... 
 Now, about a year later however, I've decided to give it another shot, and I'm hoping I'll find someone willing to help me, if some unexpected trouble arise, that quick googling couldn't easily solve. 
 So, my current "setup":
 I'm behind cg NAT, so no public IP, obviously.
 ​
 I wanted to start off clean, so:
 I have RPI4 available, I can install any supported os that you'd recommend, tho I'm pretty much counting on Raspbian lite (just that the last time I had to compile the wg for it from scratch, so, I hope i won't need to do that again...). 
 I have my lite VPS running CentOS 7, also in a completely clean state, so far only purpose would be hosting the wg server. 
 I'd normally just go with the "first" tutorial that google would find, but given that it pretty much didn't work out last time(s) I've been trying it, here I am, writing this post... 
 So, if somebody has got a "tried & true, verified working and not 3 years old" tutorial working, for exactly this purpose, (exposing services from LAN) I'm down to just following it. 
 But since I want to get it finally fully working this time, I figured I'll make a post, since honestly, I know a bit of Linux, and stuff, but god damn, sometimes I feel like I'm dense af... 
 So... anybody with a bit of spare time to help this noobish fool, set this up?

 My YNH instance is accessible from outside, everything works fine. I tried installing the redirect app to use it as a reverse proxy to access my NCPi from outside, but I guess I don't know how to configure it as it forwards to my local address (192.168.1.x) and I can only access it from home.
 I have a dedicated domain name for my NCPi instance.
 Can anyone guide me ? I don't know where to look...

 I'm enough noob on docker, so I have not understood all parameters... by the way, the stack starts but when I access the first time, it propose my the account admin creation process (some steps...) but even if I fill in the form it doesn't continue. If I restart, it open directly the login page, such as the admin creation has been completed... but putting the admin user and password of course it does not work.
 Looking at the log of the container I just see some error when try to connect to mongodb container but then they seems solved (I think the rocket.chat try several time until mongodb is up); I see also error on another container that create a bot user to chat with as a test... but I do not think it is critical.

 Does that make sense? 
 What should I be looking for and are there any "buts" or downsides?

 I am currently experimenting with Nextcloud on a Pi4 4GB + 512 GB SSD as a docker image integration on Open Media Vault on Raspberry Pi OS.
 I have decided i want to host the following for around 5 users (decreasing order of importance):
  
Next cloud - ideally not facing the internet
 VPN to home network (facing internet)
 Pi Hole for whole network (facing internet)
 Matrix (for family only with federation turned off)
 Jitsi (facing internet)
 Email
 Wallabang
 Kodi - ideally not facing the internet and
 SearX
  
Is it ideal I use multiple Pis to achieve this or do I set it up on a single Ryzen 5/7 machine. (If the latter, docker (Should I consider something like YunoHost?) vs VMs which would be better?, I won't need to scale anything except for storage in the future as the number of users is gonna be fixed)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a student and i want to try self hosting for my projects, like my personal website and other projects
 but unfortunately i don't have a raspberry pi or something
 i wanted to know are there any "always free" hosting providers that let you self host and learn selfhosting and server management?( just like the "google's always free tier")
 i am looking for always free because i don't have money to spare at the moment and my course requires me to deal with server & website related stuff for almost 4 years, but i really want to learn & try out in practical rather than just seeing online videos
 ​
 Are there any decent options for me?

I already have a dovecot/postfix server running and Protonmail is quite pricey if you have a lot of domains unless you just forward your mail through it to Protonmail but I want to be able to send as the e-mail address like you can when you link your account with Gmail and can select your from address and SMTP server to relay through. What do you guys suggest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I wasn't to clarify -- I'm not wanting DNS to add a specific port. I know that's not supported in the wild.
 If I have multiple devices that utilize the same ports, can a DNS record be used to direct the traffic to the proper device?
 As an example: a service runs on port 123. Three internal LAN devices all use port 123. Can I setup my DNS such that I can route to a specific device and avoid port forwarding?
 foo A 192.168.1.10 bar B 192.168.1.51 yop C 192.168.5.20 
 Thus by requesting foo.example.com:123, it would automatically route to 192.168.1.10:123?and yop.example.com:123 would give 192.168.5.20:123?
 This seems like it should work, but I've been unable to implement it successfully on my DNS Server. Incoming traffic from the internet does not seem to utilize the internal DNS server. Is there a way to make incoming traffic get direction from my internal DNS?
 In fact, it seems like my DNS records do nothing for redirecting incoming traffic.

I wanted something with group management and OU hierarchies that sort of follow what you would use in Active Directory. I found a lot of issues with some of the more well recommended solutions out there:
  
Samba: It's basically an AD Domain Controller which was more than I needed; also while being feature-familiar with AD is nice, I'm not looking to implement AD, I'm looking to really stick closer to just LDAP.
 GLAuth: Interesting project, but is somewhat limited in the attributes it can handle, how group management works, how the OU structure is reflected in group membership, and usability. GLauth-ui is an interesting component …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, not sure if this is the right place, but Im not sure how to google this without getting noise. I'm currently running Ubuntu as a VM on a mac mini. On that VM, i have about 20 docker containers running, including (but not limited too) Home assistant, Node Red, Pihole, Heimdal, Grocy, Organizr, Portainer, Grafana, InfluxDB, Zwave2Mqtt, ESPHome and some others.
 ​
 This afternoon, Im no longer able to access any of the web addresses, the folders shared via samba, or even SSH into the virtual machine. I can still access it on my virtual box when connecting to the mac mini. I've tried restarting and shutting down the VM, and even restarting services. Any idea what other options exist to try and get these functioning?
 I should mention that the docker containers are definitely running. And i can access home assistant through nabucasa. And automations and alexa integrations still work. I just can't access any services using the VM IP or Samab or SSH
 Never had to troubleshoot linux like this before. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks for any ideas and help.

This way I could keep track things like the buy date, price, information / description and age of the various models and accessories.
 Does anyone know of self-hosted software that would achieve this?
 I figured a finances manager, like firefly iii can be used to track the items as assets, but it would be nice if there's something more specific for this use case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone !
 I'm very exited to share with you how how I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps left by the death of google play music : the lack of possibility to synchronize playlists in an efficient way
 As google play music user my main usage was to upload my music and use it to download albums, artists or playlistson my mobile. Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.
 The solution I'm presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn't put all my brain cells into it)).
 What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)
 You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync
 I'm really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)
 I hope it will be useful to some people. Whether it's using the solution I propose or a solution based on the same principle but better suited to your own needs.
 I am of course open to all discussions and suggestions.
 PS : I'm not a native english speaker, I do my best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[title, I've been working on this on-off the last 2 years, but most progress was made the last year (lockdown amiright).
 The point is to scan your local NSFW videos & images and provide a way to organize all of that stuff. Makes it easy to search for specific content (unwatched scenes, bookmarks, ratings etc) (like: "show me all videos I've never watched featuring blondes" or whatever). Media can then be accessed by any device with a web browser.
 The app supports videos (scenes), actors/actresses, movies, studios (including substudios, networks), images and scene chapters (markers). Future versions will also support image albums.
 It scales very nicely, doesn't matter if you just have a couple of files or 10s of TB of data.

 I am lookign for a self-hosted app that has good random photo features like creating clickable random gallery / picture wall from the root folder or from the current gallery. 
  
It can create random gallery on demand
 It can create random gallery based on the currently open gallery
 It can access to the local files (so no database import)
  
I use Piwigo for this but the random stuff is very limited, and it pulls from the root albums so %95 of the the time that is not what I need. Also it does not look like there is a way to number of photo shown, it is a fixed number.
 I do not want to use static page generators since I need this stuff to be generated on demand, static page gens are useless in this case.
 thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm setting up a new home server and before I can get anything done I need to solve a unknown ssh issue.
 Heres the issue.
 ssh PC ---> New Server : ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh PC ----> Old server: works
 ssh Old Server ----> New Server: works
 ssh Mobile phone ----> New Server: works
 ssh New Server----> Old Server: works
 ssh Old Server---> PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Refused This makes sense
 ssh New Server ---> PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh Mobile ---->PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 Things I've tried:
  
Restarting all the machines involved
 Restarting the ssh client on the new server
 Turning off all the firewalls (PC and New Server)
 Enabling ssh on UFW
 Tried Reinstalling the ssh client on the new server (This changed the fingerprint, but the old server could still connect to get the changed host error)
 Pinging the New Server from the PC works. Same ping as to the old one.
  
Things I've done to the new server:
  
Apt update && apt upgrade
 apt install nvidia-headless-460-server
 echo "blacklist floppy" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-floppy.conf Do to an I/O error I dont't have a floppy
  
That's it. That is all I've done since a clean install on bare metal. The whole thing is running on a btrfs file system if that matters. I haven't enabled any encryption or anything else yet.
 This ssh service on the new server logs events for the clients that work but nothing at all coming from the PC. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea why it isn't working. I didn't test the ssh prior to the three changes above so I do not know if this was an issue previously.
 Both the old and the new server are running off the same installation image of Ubuntu server 20.04
 I would really like to get this working since I almost exclusively interact with the server using VScode on the PC.

 For fpm docker images, what's the difference between images that use alpine and those that don't?
 I'm aware that alpine is one of the leanest containers out there, but is there any drawback from using alpine in production?
 If not, then why don't all apps just skip fpm and go straight for fpm-alpine instead of giving the option for non alpine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have decided to re-setup my self hosted services. Runs under docker with traefik(1.7) as a reverse proxy/ssl provider (lets encrypt). traefik has a middle ware thing called traefik-forward-auth that allows you to tap into an oauth provider to secure your services. One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.
 I don't like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I'm being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.
 I'm curious how other people have this set up?
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is all my setup I went through over a few days of trial and error to get myself a proper sandbox'd environment for my cameras.
 I have multiple Reolink cameras connected by a PoE switch to my Raspberry pi, which acts as a DHCP server for them and runs Shinobi as the cam software.
 All camera viewing then has to be performed through the Shinobi software, which is hosted instead off my local subnet.
 The trick is utilizing the Raspberry Pi's wifi module + its ethernet port, allowing you to sandbox off the cameras to the Ethernet subnet (and thus requires a direct physical connection to access their data), and then view the camera footage over the wifi subnet (through your home router)
 I also have a NGINX configured reverse proxy server I use, as I have a website domain I host my stuff off of, which lets me access shinobi from anywhere (but requires login of course)
 Result: DIY Reverse Proxied Sandbox'd DVR
 Let me know if you have any questions!
 Step by Step Guide Link: https://gist.github.com/SteffenBlake/93d442c0413425112e17de8e13642215
 Software:
  
PuTTY to SSH into the Raspbery Pi from Windows
 Raspbian Lite OS on the Pi
 UFW Firewall
 NGINX Reverse Proxy
 isc-dhcp-server for DHCP serving IPs to the sandbox'd cameras
 Shinobi for the Camera Dashboard

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for suggestions on software, or even ideas on how to plan this out.
 We're moving house and we need new furniture for everything since our current place has it all provided.
 I was thinking of a Kanban board of some kind. Maybe one board for each room and each big item could be a "ticket" (sofa/fridge etc). Then I could have To Buy/Bought/Delivered for each column and drag each item as needed. Suggestions for each item could be added as comments.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Or is there any other way people could think to organise something like this? I would love it if there were metadata that could be assigned to each item, so I could have a cost associated to a ticket then for each room I could see how much has been spent etc.
 Whatever solution has to be able to support images on tickets. Ideally I have to get my fiance to use and if the UI is not somewhat pretty/modern I know for a fact she won't use it, no matter how good it is. I’m not sure on Kanban because I need mobile for this and from what I’ve seen a lot of them aren’t responsive on an iPhone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there - I'm pretty new to things like this but I was wondering if anyone may be able to help me.
 Say I have a webapp and I'm using something like localhost.run to expose this app that's running on my local port 5000.
 I run something like:
 ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 localhost.run 
 and now have a nice little link like:
 https://081e35c0012dd4.localhost.run 
 that I can share with the world. This seems nice, but also very insecure. Is it possible to secure this a bit more - namely without needing to self host my own server. In this case localhost.run is taking a lot of the work out of maintaining my own server and things are quite easy.
 One of my use cases is testing webhooks. For example, say the webhooks I'm testing publish which IP addresses you can expect the requests to be coming from. How would I go about allowlisting only these IP addresses to access my newly exposed app, if at all possible?
 Thanks!

A reverse proxy should take care of redirecting external incoming request to the appropriate webserver. But I am unsure about the internal clients. Should they also use the reverse proxy (Variant 1) or connect directly to the webservers (Variant 2)?
 What is your best practice?
 How do you handle certificates?
 I am fan of having the same url for external and internal clients and using offical CAs (like LetsEncrypt) for internal FQDNs. Thanks anyone for your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been happily running all my selfhosted stuff on a headless Ubuntu Server using VirtualBox for almost a decade now. While I've got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there's newer tech that is far more convenient. I'm super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) & allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I'm not even aware of! I'm less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.
 ​
 While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh & the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!
 ​
 I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I'm under the impression that the default used to be K8 & Docker & Ansible, but now it seems that K8 & Docker don't play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?
 ​
 Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management. I also run LDAP (not whole home) & 3 node Galera Cluster (HA MariaDB).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We are using OnlyOffice self hosted but only as groupware email solution - we have around 100 users, and every user has 2-5 external mailboxes connected via imap to external mail server. OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:
  
Nextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).
 Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.
 Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.
 Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. 
 Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don't want to move mx'es to our new self hosted.
  
So, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:
  
Create users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.
 Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.
 Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.
 It's ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.
  
Many thanks for any suggestions!

 Does anyone run it? How is the performance? Did you have to use AWS s3 or does it store files locally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friends are finally considering moving away from Discord after recent drama, and I've been searching for a suitable program for a few months. I have looked at and rejected Mattermost (doesn't have the permissions I need) and Rocket.Chat (has half the permissions but runs too slow). 
 What I really need is a chat server that can be used to restrict file uploads to specific rooms or user roles, and, at the very least, has the capability to create an 'arrivals' system, where users show up to a single room before being invited to the chat at large. My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don't want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. 
 I'm currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it's unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't used it, Tailscale solves so many problems with connectivity / port forwarding / security. Run it on all your machines and log in, and they're all connected and their hostnames resolve (i.e. http://mycomputer:8080). It solves One Problem, with absolutely zero config headache. I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don't mind that Tailscale isn't fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way
 It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you'd want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)
 I have no association with the project btw, I'm solely an extremely happy free-tier user

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
