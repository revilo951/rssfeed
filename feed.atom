        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've typically just been installing stuff I want to self host on my main PC, but lately I've been playing around with VirtualBox and I'm interesting in hosting a few things on VMs.
 I went to setup Nextcloud on a VM last night and I immediately ran into something I'm unsure about - what OS should I use? I don't need fancy desktop environments or extra bloat like OS's that come packaged with libreoffice, thunderbird, firefox, etc.
 For you guys self-hosting in VMs, how do you decide what OS to use? Is there an OS that's generally seen as the go-to default OS for self-hosting apps on VMs? Or do you just pick something familiar like Ubuntu/CentOS and not worry about the extra bloat?

 I was installing Ubooquity, using the 5 minute installation guide here https://vaemendis.github.io/ubooquity-doc/pages/installation-guide.html 
 But after the .jar file installs all of the necessary folders and files, nothing happens. No desktop interface opens up. I've executed the Ubooquity.jar file a bunch of times, and nothing happens. 
 I'm either not doing something right myself, or something is wrong with either my setup or the program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many of you, I'm using Nginx Proxy Manager. It been a great tool so far. What would be the best way to add basic monitoring and/or stats for the proxy? Just something like how many hits a proxy has gotten, errors, etc. Most of this data is in the logs, so really could just be a web GUI on top of that I suppose.
 From what I can tell, Nginx Proxy Manager is just a dressed up version of Nginx, so maybe just a standard plug-and-play nginx monitoring tool would work?
 It looks like Traefik has a bit more of this functionality built in, but I really like Nginx Proxy Manager and would rather not switch if I don't have to.
 Thanks!
 edit: I'm running Nginx Proxy Manager in docker
 something like this could work...https://learn.netdata.cloud/guides/collect-apache-nginx-web-logs but I'm guessing I'd need to mess with the log collector to run inside the nginx container, which doesn't seem too great...but that may be unavoidable as any external monitoring solution (ie not native to nginx) would need access to the logs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys n ladies! :)
 I‘ve a question related to this posts title.
 I set up a nextcloud server with a storage box on a Hetzner server. Working really good (went the docker way) and i like nextcloud pretty much.
 The main purpose i am using a VPS with a storage box is that my internet connection at home is pretty slow (80/15) regarding file transfer. If my upload would be better i would have hosted everything locally, maybe in the future.
 So i would like to have a bidirectional sync between my Nextcloud data and a local folder on my synology nas. This way all my files are in my local network and i could access them quickly because of gbit lan and on the other side i can access them quickly everywhere else because of the good upload speed from the VPS.
 And the main reason is also that if i change files locally, they can be synced to my nextcloud and vice versa.
 The only way i found would be WebDAV with Cloud Sync. But is that the best and only way?
 I tried also with a vpn connection and mount the nextcloud files folder to the nas and with sftp mount. Then with rsync, but thats not really working like i want to.
 Du you have some ideas?
 Greetings :)

 I was thinking I could do this with MailCow and an email relay, but the ones I find online like sendgrid or mailgun only talk about sending email, not receiving it, or need a webhook to forward the received email. 
 Is there a service which could be setup for cheap to receive email for arbitrary mailboxes and arbitrary domains for cheap, which would then be polled by Mailcow to download the email, then delete it from their service?
 My main domain is with a reputable specialized email host, but want a cheap way to setup alternate domains for testing and side projects. I am not looking to send too many emails, but might want to setup some kind of mailing list at some point. I'm not too concerned about the privacy, or even reliability (within reason), as long as it can guarantee mail availability for at least 24h and email I send through them will not be blocked by gmail or outlook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background:
 I've recently set up a torrent seedbox/mini home server on my Raspberry Pi 3something. I've got it running qBittorrent-nox, Aria2 (following this and this tutorials,with AriaNg frontend served via Apache), and filebrowser/SFTP/Samba for file access. I had some other services running, but I've stopped them for the moment. I've set Aria2 and qBittorrent to download to /media/pi/Downloads, which is the automatic mount point for my 500GB HDD (NTFS, via FUSE)
 Problem: 
 It doesn't download torrents. When I add a torrent in qBittorrent web interface, it'll grab the metadata, list tens or hundreds of peers, then I'll watch the download speed drop down from KB/s to bytes/s to zero and stop. The same torrent, when added to the Aria2 web interface, will download slowly (though I have seen the first one I tried download at 4 Mbit/s which is very good for my internet). I'm nervous to stick exclusively with Aria2, however, as, despite downloading the torrents, I can't tell whether it seeds them or not. It goes into "seeding" mode, but uploads remain at 0 Kb/s. I need to be able to seed, to use it with a private tracker or two.
 Question:
 Can anyone please help me figure out what's wrong with qBittorrent, why it's not downloading or seeding torrents, and how to fix it? Is Aria2 actually seeding and I just can't see it? Is there any way to tell?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys.
 I don't really know which sub is right for me since I wasn't able to find the cause of the problem yet.
 My setup:
 Home Server running OMV (debian) and Nextcloud 21.0.2, wireguard and a few other services.
 Port forwarding on my ISPs Router (80+443+wireguard port) for my nextcloud instance and wireguard.
 Dyndns and a cname record with my dyndns record at cloudflare, which is the DNS Nameserver for my domain.
 If I decide to use cloudflare as a proxy, everything works as expected with the disadvantage of slower upload speeds from my local network, since everything has to pass "the internet" instead of staying in my local network. But nextcloud is fast, responsible and just works.
 If I on the other hand use "only DNS" without cloudflares proxy, my whole nextcloud instance is barely usable. Every loading of a page takes 10-30s and I sometimes even get a timeout.
 I did not change anything on the configuration of my router, nextcloud or anything. I at most updated my OMV via (apt-get update && apt-get upgrade) and my ISP is rolling out automatic updates to my router without letting me know or decide about it. 
 What could be a good starting point to locate the cause of this issue? Has someone experienced similar issues? Thanks for your help and sorry for my bad english.

 I've got off site backups. But they are encrypted, the encryption keys are in Bitwarden and I'm not self hosting that. To access Bitwarden I know my master password but I need 2FA, which would be the authenticator app on my phone or my YubiKey, both of which may be lost in a fire. I could also use email but that's just shifting the problem because again I'd need my phone and Bitwarden to get into that. There's also the recovery code but where should I keep that so it's secure and recoverable? 
 I feel like once I get into Bitwarden the rest is easy, I can access my emails, off site backups, and decryption keys. It might take a while but I think it would be doable assuming I had that recovery code.
 Does anyone ever test their DR plan? Can you eventually access decrypted backups with nothing but a new computer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Trying to figure out how to best host my photos and move away from hosted cloud. Previously I hosted own cloud and switched to nextcloud.
 Currently paused sync untill all my files are nicely structured again and was researching photo management. Photoprism seams a clear winner. My goal would be to sync my photos from laptop and phone to nextcloud and have photoprism recognize all important features.
 A few questions arise when reading through it all: -does photoprism need to make a extra copy of that file? Or will it just add all the info to the "nextcloud" photo. (plenty of storage, so not a major issue) -will the photoprism info also show in the nextcloud environment? -is there a android app to browse through my photos or can I only access it via webinterface -does it change file structure (Pictures/2021/2021-01/filename.jpg)
 Ideally all my photos would be indexed/labeled on all devices so a backwards sync option would be great but not sure that is in the scope of all platforms involved. 
 Is there a clear instruction to run it without docker?

 I followed this tutorial about setting up Docker with Traefik reverse proxy and Portainer as I thought it would suit the set up I would like to achieve. Previously I've run services with Apache virtual hosts. 
 While it's taken me a while to get a basic handle on Docker it seems like it might be a quicker easier way to deploy and maintain services - once I get to grips with it. If anyone feels this tutorial doesn't create a good foundation to build on please let me know, or point me to a better one.
 What I'd like is secure access to service1.mydomain.com, service2.mydomain.com etc. For what it's worth I'm looking at running Seattle, Plex, Pihole, Tautulli, and perhaps Syncthing and maybe another music-oriented media server (Jellyfin?)

Is there a good preferably free place I can find an smtp server for very low volume usage? I very much do not want to self-host an email server for such a minor use.

 I have recently happened to look again at Yunohost, and the project seems to have really matured in the past 4 years. I am tempted to switch to their solution, especially to benefit from the plentiful stack of packages available and optimised. 
 My question for you fellow self-hosters is this: has anyone had any experience with Yunohost, and specifically their Nextcloud package, on a RPi? Does it work well enough? Have you had the chance to compare it with Dietpi's version?

 For some context, I've recently turned an old laptop of mine into a LAMP server and I've gotten it set up with my custom domain and everything. However, I've noticed that I cannot access my custom website or anything from my server unless I'm on the same network that my server is on. 
 I've set up an OpenVPN server on it, and it works when I'm on the network, but my connection times out when I try to connect from another network.
 Basically, I'd like to be able to work on/have full admin access to my server when I'm at work or something but I don't really know what I'm doing.
 Thank you in advance for yourself!

 Well not quite, I did find a gist on github, that essentally gave me a solid foundation to push this further myself.
 Long story short, here is: praul/autoreply (https://github.com/praul/autoreply)

 On my Google account I have setup 2FA and account activity, however, I have a concern that all the security of my accounts purely rely on no one getting access to my Google account. 
 Would using Bitwarden really elevate that? And is it worth the risk moving it from a reliable cloud service to a self hosted system?

 Link to MonicaCRM
 The specific issue I'm having is any docker-compose file you make doesn't seem to matter when it comes to MySQL credentials. The app appears to be obsessed with having the db username has 'homestead'. I have no idea why, I've asked on the 'Dockerholics' group on Facebook and nobody seems to know.
 However, I've seen that someone of you have managed to install it? Could you shine some light on it?
 This is my YAML for the stack, the only thing I've changed is the app secret. I've tried changing the MySQL credentials to various things but the log still outputs this:
 "MySQL Connection Error: (1045) Access denied for user 'homestead'@'172.24.0.3' (using password: YES)"

 I've found a few older posts and look at some software but they appear to be very much geared toward businesses. I also looked at Firefly but it seems to be very manual on the imports. If there isn't really anything that can do automatic imports and I have to go manual route that's fine, just not sure if there is anything better then firefly.

 for a long Time I searched for a self hosted solution for my Song collection. I was with none of the options I tried really happy. So I decided to develop my own one.
 Hypnos - The selfhosted audio cloud
 Hypnos reads your Songs from a local folder. It uses the Metadata in the files and can use the cover art in the same folder as the Songs/Album. It is 100% free (GPL3) software. Including the javascript(LibreJS compatible). It consists of a back-end service written in rust called Soil and a Typescript front-end called Solanum.
 Your songs will transparently be transcoded to a format that your Browser will understand if required.
 While Hypnos is still very primitive in many areas (no playlist, no user management, etc..) the core feature browsing an playing your Music works.
 I'm posting this here in case some of you find Hypnos interesting/useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Last week I released auto-docker-dash a simple dashboard to show you the status of your docker containers.
 After a massive overhaul of the application, this week we've rebranded and it's now known as Plugsy.
 ​
 https://reddit.com/link/o8w7h5/video/eavyy8orys771/player
 New features
 Connectors
 Plugsy now supports multiple connectors that can gather status' independently. This will allow us to build many more connector types in the future such as Kubernetes, Traefik, Caddy etc. I'd love to get some feedback on which would be useful to the self-hosted community.
 Connectors that are currently supported:
 Docker
 This is the original, but with the new file configuration, you can now add multiple docker instances/sockets to gather statuses from different locations
 Website
 This is a simple connector that will perform a simple status code check for the given URL, it can also check for a specific regex in the response.
 Raw
 For those links that you just want on your dashboard, you can now include them directly in config.
 Agent Mode
 Plugsy now supports agent mode, allowing you to push changes from 1 Plugsy container to another.
 This is useful should you have multiple docker/connected environments that you'd like to monitor from a single dashboard.

 After a long hiatus of matrix after being a very early adopter I have dived back in.
 Lets just say playbook was a little bit perplexing until I worked out what I was doing.
 Its setup quite nice and have multiple bridges running, which has really allowed me to get rid of Facebook messenger and other spyware off my phone. (sadly it is well used among friends)
 What I cant seem to understand at present, is how often should I be pulling in the new git playbook and essentially running an update?
 Is it mature enough that I can just insert this into an update script and run at leisure? Or do I need to keep an eye on the changelog for monumental breaking things? Can I just set up a watch for the playbook changelog file in git and update only when that is listed as changed, etc.
 What are you doing to keep it updated?

 Full details can be found on the Github page, and you can either install it as a standard Django app in a virtual environment or use one of the containers (I build for most architectures, happy to add more if there's one you really need!)
 It's released under the MIT license, so all issues/suggestions/pull requests are welcome!

 ​
 If anyone is looking for an open source self hosted analytics, I strongly recommend plausible.
 I have made a blog post on making it production ready (including nginx reverse proxy and TLS certs using let's encrypt)

It's not really open source in the full sense. More like only "we publish the source". They do not interact with the community and Github issues are either ignored or replied with a single sentence and then ignored.
 Their Docker image is terrible. It runs as root, and even worse, it is chained to their own MariaDB configuration (it requires me to give it root password of my MariaDB)
 Files are stored in their proprietary format. I understand that this is necessary for deduplication and file history to work, but the tools to deal with that format are a hassle…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Self-Hosters, 
 I was wondering if anyone is able to recommend a good self-hosted financial management system. Ideally what I'm looking for is:
  
Handle multiple Income accounts
 Track multiple savings goals across different bank accounts
 Handle redraw mortgage accounts
 Have a web UI for managing across the local network
  
I'm not really fussed about importing transactions directly from my bank, I can enter that manually (and am just about paranoid enough to not trust any service). Currently, I'm using a google spreadsheet to tell me how much I need to add to each account on a fortnightly basis and to record expenditure against those accounts. I don't need to generate invoices.
 Preferring a self-hosted system rather than something I login to over the internet for privacy reasons, and would like something that I can put in a container or a VM so that its accessible on the home network for my wife to be able to access.
 Something simple to use would be a bonus (to keep the wife happy). 
 Also I'm not an accountant, so if I haven't explained myself very well please let me know. 
 Thanks everyone!

 I want to share Plex with my friends - the easy way. Since I'm behind a double Nat I can't forward any ports. My setup is:
 My Plex server is a local unraid NAS. Tailscale is installed in a docker. 
 Tailscale is also installed on a public facing VPS. This VPS is running nginx Proxy Manager, making Plex avaible at a public domain, secured with SSL.
 My question is: Is it possible to sniff (see what type of contend is streamed)? Every connection is encrypted, but does that mean that it is impossible to know what is streamed? (I'm a noob when it comes to that, sorry). I just don't want to get post from authorities or layers demanding huge amounts of money because of my media server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pterodactyl Panel is a wrapper around docker which is intended to help create and manage game servers.
 I have a VPS server that I've been using for the past 3 years and I host a few light-weight applications on there. Recently, a group of friends and I decided we want to play Valheim and I thought it'd be a great idea to host a dedicated server on the VPS using pterodactyl panel.
 Now, I wouldn't say I'm an expert at this. I'm a software developer by trade, but in setting up various things on my VPS I've learned a thing or two over the years.
 But Pterodactyl Panel has defeated me. It is written in PHP. I followed both official documentation and community guides. I asked countless questions on their discord. I am faced by problem after problem, some of which I can't find any help with at all. It's a nightmare. The only solution I see is to either hire a sysadmin to do this for me, or to look for alternatives.
 Anyway, sorry about the rant. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 I've also considered just dumping pterodactyl entirely and just building my own docker images with the servers I need. Would that be a better idea?

 The idea is to record instances where delivery driver leaves slip without attempting to deliver customer's package, fakes signatures, etc.
 Appreciate leads for self hosted software or even WordPress plugins that could be a good start

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 for some time already I've been working on setting up my all-in-one self-hosted home server that one day should server as my go-to for many things ranging from development to NAS. I'm trying to manage as much as possible from a single repository with Ansible. At the moment I'm at the current state:
  
Ubuntu Server
 K3s Kubernetes cluster single node
 ZFS Pool with a bunch of HDDs
 SSDs
 bunch of other smaller things
  
So far I have not a single utility running that requires any persistent storage. This obviously has to change. And with that I also have to think about redundancy, backups, restoring, and so on. Doing all this on a plain filesystem would be nothing new to me.
 A few random questions:
  
Should I handle backup and snapshots of stuff running in K8s also in K8s? Or do everything on the host OS?
 hostPath volumes? local persistent volumes? longhorn? velero?
  
Would be great if you could share your take on this topic.

 Consider it like what pi-hole is for DNS queries, same thing for port 80 and 443 , so that all requests and responses can be logged and analysed in a cool dashboard.
 Custom solution that I know is : 
  
Add nginx logging in a linux box, pass all router traffic to it
 setup EKS , filebeat / logstash for parsing these logs, Elastic search as a datastore and Kibana for beautiful graphs and analysis.
  
​
 But will like to have a plug and play and a beautiful pi-hole like project if such a thing exists.

 I am using onedrive storage + android app to manage automatic backup of photos from my phone and cameras. 
 I am looking for a solution that will allow a unidirectional "backup" of this data from onedrive to my server I.e. create a local copy every x days. As far as I know onedrive doesn't have native folder sync with ubuntu.
 I am wanting to do it this way (rather than phone->server->cloud) as I can't trust 99.9% uptime of my own hardware.
 At the same time I want to package up backups of my docker configs/data and send that to onedrive.
 Can this be done easily with syncthing or rsync?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks, your help will be much appreciated, a client of mine asked me if there's any way he can make his service more speedy and up to modern days. 
 Current workflow:
 He does dental prosthesis, so, one dentist sends him a piece to work with an attached paper order with the name of the patient and what's needed to be done. So he inputs patient name/type of job/date to be delivered into google calendar and that's pretty much it. This might happen a few times with the same piece of work. Every other detail is manually typed in some excel that its only accessible locally. 
 Intended workflow:
 Input patient name/type of job/date to be delivered with a tracking number so any dentist can view in which state the job is, possibly with a QR code that could be printed in the labels for each dentist to keep track of how many jobs are done monthly with each one.
 Of course more features can be applied, I was thinking this more as a logistics kind of software rather than a medical one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started making ChoreRewards a few weeks ago, which is essentially a reward system build for children. If the child does a chore, they get points which they can then use to "purchase" items. 
 It's purpose is to give children the sense of accomplishment, as they will be able to mark their chores as "done" and to teach the value of money; should I purchase X now, or save up my "points" and purchase Y? 
 Anyway, V0.1 of the backend is almost ready and I thought I'd see if there are any frontend devs who want to help me build it out? 
 I can do frontend, by which I mean I can muddle around and make something functional; but I don't have a UX bone in my body.
 Happy to discuss more about the project, answer questions, or tell me you're interested in the project itself if you think it might be something you can use when it's ready!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure if this has been discussed recently, but I am looking for an iCloud alternative for my Apple devices. I know there are lots of services that can replace some individually (like using NextCloud), but I am looking for what the best options are. One thing that I am really wanting is something similar to iMazing which looks like an amazing product but just a little outside my use case (and if something else will do it for free, all the better).
 What I like about iMazing is that I can backup and manage all of my data (messages, photos, apps, the works) from a remote location with a UI that is very similar to iTunes. I'm trying to set up a family backup of photos and iPhones for my parents and siblings and so having that ease of use is key. The downside of iMazing is that the unlimited plan only lets me have 2 computers with keys so only myself and one other household can manage their devices or I can get lifetime keys for 10 devices but I need more future proofing because we will have more iPhones in the family inevitably. 
 What is your setup for iOS backup and management for your home setups and specifically what is your ideal photo backup setup that you use for those people who aren't tech savvy (i.e parents/siblings).

 I am running a small hypervisor with about 50 vm's for me and some friends.
 One of them pointed me at sonatype's repomanager that would let me cache registries like apt, yum, dnf, npm, docker etc. 
 This would speed up lots of things in our environment. However it seem like there is no CE of this product and it costs a yearly subscription fee.
 Is there a simular product like repomanager I could use?
 Any reccomendations welcome :)

 But I have no idea how to do that. First I'm doubting whether I should use Nginx, Apache, Caddy (since I've heard it's fairly easy to setup) or something like Traefik, and once chosen that how I'd have to make it so everything goes through the proxy to then be redirected.
 Any tips or suggestions?

 some time Last night I received a dmarc report from mail.ru. According to the report, three IP addresses from Laos and Kenya tried to send e-mails impersonating my domain name, as SPF and DKIM all failed.
 A friend of mine, who also self hosts his email did also receive a dmarc report for his domain, also from mail.ru.
 I guess someones currently trying to mass-impersonate?
 Are there any of you guys, that also received such a report? 
 As far as I know there is not much I can do prevent them from pulling this kind of shit, is it?
 Does stuff like this happen often? I've only been selfhosting my email for about a year now and I've never seen a dmarc report that I didn't trigger myself...
 The IP addresses are:

 I'm looking for a selfhosted autoresponder for multiple mail accounts from different providers. 
 Not all of them are offering decent autoresponder settings on the server side.
 The autoresponder would have to check for new emails over imap and then send autoresponds over smtp.
 Basically just like an email client with filters, but running on a 24-7 server - and not interfering with the actual email clients.
 Does anyone know a good solution?
 Thanks in advance
 edit: my google searches return a lot of newsletter tools. I'm not looking for anything newsletter related. Just a simple "I'm on vacation" Message on incoming email.
 in Germany we use the term autoresponder for it. This maybe wrong. I'm looking for a tool that sends "out of office" notices

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dream of having some sort of home page with metrics about personal goals, calendar events, and other services. Because I'd like it to be open-source, I looked into Nextcloud, which is awesome but it lacks goal-tracking and a wiki, which I'd really like to have. I have also looked into "Personal Management System", which looks really interesting, but it lacks the community behind Nextcloud in order to earn my trust to use it in the long run. Ideally it would be awesome to be able to visualize all aspects of life, while retrieving this data from the top services of each category. Imagine a home page with a Kanboard from WeKan, storage from Nextcloud, goal tracking (maybe Nomie?), some notes in form of a wiki...
 ​
 What sort of set up would you recommend that satisfies this, or at least gets close to it? Sorry if I make some mistakes, English is not my first language.
 ​
 ** Maybe someone may suggest that I should contribute to some of these projects in order to create the features I wish to see. I would love to, however at this moment in time I lack the necessary skills.
 ** EDIT **
 Let me clarify for those who didn't get the gist of what I'm trying to communicate: I'm looking for something analogous to what Android/iOS is to Widgets. 
 You have a main screen that show information and functionalities from the system or third party services/apps that are easily visualized and/or manipulated. So far I found Nextcloud+nextcloud apps to satisfy most of these needs, but I still miss some resources as mentioned above. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting here at the recommendation on another subreddit. 
 I have about 1500 movie/TV Series library all on DVD's/BD. I took the time to rip the entire library. I took my time and it took me about 3 years to rip and convert it. Unfortunately a good 2/3 of the files were corrupted because of a bad RAID set up I was using at the time. I have since upgraded to a 4K TV and set up the latest Apple TV and I wanted to rebuild my library. I'm wondering if there's a better way to do this. Not only is ripping/transcoding time consuming, but now that I finally own a 4K HDR TV, there's no pointing re-ripping my DVD collection. I have hard copies, so I think licensing isn't an issue. I also have a spreadsheet with name of every movie I own with IMDB link. Is there a better way to do this? Torrent? How would I automate this on my TrueNAS and just have it slowly rebuild it overtime...mostly unattended of course. Is this possible?

 I was thinking to host a few projects using a cellphone internet data plan as a failover when my actual internet is out.
 Can anyone point me in the right direction as to a good device to route a cellphone internet plan, and basically make a hotspot for home usage?
 I think I looked this up before, and the decent one I think is like $500, but I can't remember the dang name of the device.
 Also, are there even cellphone providers that allow this?
 Thanks!

 ​
 I run docker on my synology nas along with a few containers, including the above. Within the containers i sometimes have a hard time accessing lan devices. For instance, if i am using node red and i put a tp link kasa node, it finds nothing. If i were to run node red on my raspberry pi and apply the same node it finds all my lan tp link smart plugs. Besides adding the containers to a macvlan on the synology nas, is there any other way to get around this issue? I created a macvlan, but now the issue is whenever i connect to my home vpn (it runs on the same nas as docker) i can not access those ips on the macvlan.
 ​
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 Over the past week or two I have been working on a web application that allows you to explore your DJI drone footage on a map! I am finally confident enough to tell you about it, so that those interested can test it and try it for themselves. 
 In order for it to work the footage has to have been shot with the subtitle telemetry settings enabled.
 https://github.com/vimodev/dronemap
 https://hub.docker.com/r/vimodev/dronemap
 Features
  
Footage directory scanning
 Automatic parsing and analysis of DJI footage
 Exploration of extracted datapoints on a map
 Filtering map markers based on footage attributes
 Watching raw footage from which data points originated
  
Screenshots
 Example usage.
 Satellite view.
 OpenStreetMap view.
 Inspecting a datapoint.
 ​
 Viewing datapoint origin in original footage.
 Remarks
  
The styling is lackluster due to my personal disregard for design. It can of course be improved in due time.
 It has been developed with and tested for DJI Mini 2 footage only. I have no other footage available to me. I am running with the assumption that other DJI footage is in the same format with regards to the subtitled data points DJI optionally includes.
 If you encounter any issues please submit them on github.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, first time posting to this sub. I've spent the last week scouring the interwebs and I haven't found anyone talking about what I'm trying to do. Any help would be very greatly appreciated. 
 I'm trying to connect two remote locations together. Both locations have a dynamic IP address. Everything I've seen so far has suggested using a Dynamic DNS service or buying a domain name and using a free Dynamic DNS. Those are great ideas but I know there's got to be a way to do this for free. If it can't be done, then it can't be done, but purely on principle I feel like it's total bullshit that there's no free alternatives that don't rely on the whim of an ISP or third party services. 
 This is what I was thinking, neither IP changes all that frequently, maybe once every month or 2. Additionally, it seems very unlikely that both IP's would change at exactly the same time. Would it be possible to run an automatic process at both locations that would constantly update their IP's to one another? 
 So we have location A and location B that constantly talk to each other and update the IP address. At location A, the IP address changes. Now, location B doest know the new IP address of location A. Because the two IP's didn't change at the same time, location A still knows the IP address of location B and subsequently can send the updated IP address. 
 Anyone know if anything like this exists or have any ideas for free alternatives? 
 On a side note, I have an old TPlink Archer A9 that I'm not using, it has a free Built-in ddns with tp-link. I switched over to an edge router. Is there anyway I could put the A9 in a DMZ on the network and have it only for updating the ddns? Could I switch to IPV6?
 Honestly, any free and automated ideas would be perfect. Would love to hear what you guys and gals think!
 Thanks again

 Is there a similar self-hosted private offline webpage archiving solution that is specifically designed to accept all cookies (and preferably block ads from being archived as well)? For example, The Internet Archive (archive.org) does this somewhat better.

 I could host a url shortener, but that's not a very short url..
 I could run a Pilk instance https://pilk.root.gg/#/ but I think that could be misused.
 I am willing to simply host a site that explains the differences between malware and viruses. 
 Point is I own it for a year, and wouldn't mind giving back to the community at large. What services do you wish you had? What level of service would you be willing to trust such a outlandish url? How many of you thought it was just as funny as I?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kasm Workspaces delivers interactive access to GUI applications and desktop environments running in docker containers. The containers are streamed directly to the browser. The platform is similar to Citrix and VMware Horizon, but entirely container based. 
 ​
 ​
 Kasm Workspaces
 ​
 The quickest way to see what we are about is to launch a demo session using any of the following links. No install - No sign-up - just solve a captcha. 
  
Ubuntu Bionic Desktop
 Google Chrome
 Visual Studio Code
  
(Note: Traffic filtering and timeout features are enabled to limit abuse)
 While Workspaces is a commercial product, we have roots in /r/selfhosted and /r/homelab style communities so it’s always been a priority to offer a free, self-hosted, easy-to-install, feature rich community edition. 
 ​
 The core components of the platform are also open source.
  
KasmVNC in the streaming tech used to deliver interactive access to the containers via the browser. (https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC)
 All of our application and desktop images are open source as well. (https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-images) - (https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-core-images)
  
​
 Folks commonly use Workspaces for….
  
Secure and private internet access leveraging disposable browser containers.
 Remote access solution for VDI (ahem CDI) / Development / Bastion Hosts / Training environments
 Integrate into existing platforms/environments by leveraging our API
 Slaying demons in hell
  
​
 If you'd like to run Workspaces yourself, you can Download and Install the software on popular Linux distros. I hope this provides something of value to this community and I appreciate any feedback. 
 Thanks to the mods for allowing me to post.

 I'm aware I could have nmap run periodically and diff the changes which would send an alert but I wondered if a tool already existed or as a part of an already existing NMS. It'd just be nice to have features like history and and nice web interface, like Shodan Monitor has.

I literally have no clue what I'm doing and know nothing about setting up this kind of stuff. I tried looking for other resources but the two or three websites I could find about this just used the same pictures lol. Can somebody hold my hand and walk me through how to set this up? If not, that's fine. I've been trying to figure this out for hours and coming here was my last resort. I'll probably just give up on it.

 I think it was called "rsync-diff" or "rsync-backup" or something but that doesn't bring anything up. Thanks in advance if anyone knows something.
 Edit: aah I just found it! It's called rsnapshot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Pretty much my entire question is in the subject line:
 If I Set Up Guacamole with 2FA behind a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX Proxy Manager), do I still need a VPN server? Why/why not?
 I realize using a VPN would be the most secure way to go about things, but I'm still pretty new to self-hosting, and I'm not entirely clear on what security vulnerabilities I'd be at risk for if I just set things up like this:
 remote client <--> public internet <--> https://guacamole.exampledomain.com (Cloudflare proxied domain with Cloudflare-issued SSL certificate) <--> NGINX Proxy Manager (reverse proxy) on RPI serving HTTPS connections <--> guacamole server with Google Authenticator/2FA on RPI (docker) <--> servers behind Guacamole.
 Assuming nothing evil is happening with the SSL certificate on my guacamole subdomain, where is the security risk that makes a VPN necessary? Is the concern packet sniffing while connected to the public internet at a Starbucks (that is, the use case for VPN generally), or is there something specifically insecure about running guacamole this way?

 Some of my main questions are:
  
Should I provide more inline comments or try to have all the explanations in their own box? 
 Is it easier or harder to follow when all the outputs are saved and displayed?
 Should I have the download scripts included or have the user download the images themselves?
  
Thanks for all the help!

 I wanted to learn BASH and in addition learn the Linux operating system usually the best.
 I wanted to create for myself some purpose, for example: Set up a NextCloud server from scratch
 But I set up such a server, I finished successfully, and yet I still feel that my knowledge is low
 Do you have any ideas for home apps and services or server that I could set up?
 I would love advice on all areas and not just a home cloud. I would love all ideas of all kinds, such as home monitoring, information security and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Like the title says, I'm looking for a self-contained server or combination of code and packages (e.g.: nginx, Ruby, Python, etc) to host a local website with mostly documentation of my homelab.
 It should support online editing with an option for WYSIWYG (if possible), Markdown syntax and redering with Mermaid and/or PlantUML support and backend based on static files (.md and .yaml would be perfect).
 I've checked a number of open-source and free wiki and documentation packages out there that includes most features above, but they all seem to rely on some sort of database to store the data and settings.
 Relying on a database makes me worry about backup procedures and how to migrate the docs to different tool in the future. I'd rather prefer to just have a bunch of folders with md/png/svg/yaml files 😆 
 At the moment, I'm considering deploying a local Gitlab instance, it does all I need but the WYSIWYG editing.
 Would you have any suggestions? Likely, I skipped some obvious choices for you (say, e.g., perhaps WordPress does the job!), so please feel free to share any inputs, they'll be very appreciated.
 Thanks!

I am looking for a very simple solution to hosting/sharing a folder (+/-100GB) on my Mac mini with 3-5 friends. I use my Mac mini as a plex server so it is always running. I have a folder of various audiobooks, books and music that I want them to be able to access on their Mac/PC and download whatever they want whenever they want. Dropbox works nicely but I am not interested in paying for the extra storage and I don't need anything stored in the cloud. 
 What suggestion do you have for my best option to look into?

 With Joplin Server you have the possibility to host your notes yourself. There are a lot of desktop apps for almost every system and mobile apps for iOS and Android. 
 With optional end-to-end encryption, you also have one of the most secure note servers around.

 Previously my wife & I used Out of Mil, which was nice. But not self-hosted. It did however, work. Now that they've been brought out and will no longer work for non US based users, we can no longer use it.
 Grocy looked like it may fit the bill, but it's a bit too complete. I need the all important spousal-approval factor. Adding a new item in a shopping list required setting the item up first, we just need something to show a checklist really.
 So, TL;DR. I'm looking for something, self hosted that'll allow us to create a list, with the ability to check items off as they're picked up. The list needs to be available to multiple users. Ideally needs a companion Android app, but PWA is perfectly fine too.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have been searching for a solution to my music 'needs'. Different solutions exist, but I seem to be unable to find a solution that just 'does it all'. Basically I'm looking for a selfhosted Spotify-like solution without the fancy 'I think you will like this music'-suggestions. :)
 I have a self built NAS with all my music on it, a receiver in my living room (Yamaha R-N303D, DLNA/Airplay capable), a RPi with speakers connected to it in my bathroom (running piCorePlayer at the moment), and a bunch of smartphones, tablets etc.
 I am looking for a selfhosted solution that enables me to:
  
maintain my music collection (e.g. scan music into a database, playlist manipulation, etc) using a nice web user interface
 listen to the music using a web browser (using the same nice web user interface), so that I can access my music remotely
 control what is playing on the home appliances in my home (receiver and RPi)
 sync subsets of my music files (certain playlists) to my tablets, smartphones, etc. so that I can listen to it while I'm offline (car, commute on public transportation, etc.)
  
The solutions that I found so far are either good at 1/streaming to a browser, or 2/ streaming to home appliances (for example Airsonic vs. Logitech Media Server). But I'm looking for a marriage of both.
 Any suggestions/thoughts on how I can achieve this?

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.

It can serve its place somewhere in my network. So, I booted it up at first, being the first time I initially plugged it in, and got a "Booting..." on the LCD. I figured all was well so I moved it to my rack and plugged it in and now its shows "█ █ █ █ █ █ █ █" for some apparent reason. I dont know what happened as there is practically zero documentation pertaining to the issue. I've also tried resetting it but also did not work. 
 I figured maybe one of yall might've experience the same thing if youve ever had a Thecus NAS.

 I've been playing with docker a bit on my synology NAS and I think I'm ready to try something a bit more difficult. I'd like to set things up so that three small JAMStack-based (Gatsby and Hexo) websites I have could be built and deployed from my NAS instead of github actions.
 However, my knowledge of self-hosted build systems is very old (circa 2008). Does anyone have any suggestions for an environment that is working well for you? Currently the code for the sites is hosted on github and deployed to (very) inexpensive hosting via FTP, although that's subject to change as I bring more stuff back to the home network.

 So I got myself a RaspberryPi 4B 4Go and started everything from scratch. It took me like 2 months and several sleepless nights to manage to get a proper Nextcloud instance running, even though I can't get Collabora to work. So I decided to try and install CryptPad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm selfhosting Vaultwarden (formerly known as bitwarden_rs) on docker. The machine (ubuntu) is not reachable from the internet (by design), thus I could't make a Lets Encrypt DNS challenge. 
 I found mkcert, installed it on the same ubuntu machine and manually added the certs to the docker container. All works for me. I'm just wondering if there are any security concerns with this solution? If so, what are they and how would you proceed instead?

 I'm searching for a way to setup something Like Pritunl (or any other VPN Server) on a local machine, and make it accessible from the outside, so that I can share my Plesk Server and NAS with some friends.
 I don't have access to the router. I thought about services Like ngrok, but they are quite expensive for such a task, and I have enough VPS Servers and capacity to host something like that myself. 
 Since I'm fine with hosting it myself I wanted to ask you if you have any advice how to set it up the best way, or any Tutorial you could link me to.
 Thank you :)

 ​
 i already did a bit of research. My Company is looking for a documentation/wiki software which is self hosted and mostly free. We need advanced permission management, Active Directory support and it should be easy to use and to setup.
 ​
 I installed xwiki and wikijs. Both look kinda easy, but wikijs is the handling for users a bit difficulty in my opinion. XWiki looks like from 1990 but I guess its all dependable on extensions there. Overall it seems also to be way more complicated.
 ​
 Any hints on hidden gems or similiar?

The network adapter is currently not working as expected, it doesn't use an IP adress. I want to use the server as part of the network of the host machine directly connencted to the router. I want to ssh into the server with an Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 also using network bridge where everything works fine.
 I want to use the server as a storage for SnipeIT and it needs to be setup on a server with internet connectivity and a static IP adress. I will also install ApacherServer on it.
 Current netplan setup
 How does the netplan need to be setup? Which parameters do I need to use?

 I'm hosting multiple services at home, and was wondering what would be the best way to manage the domain names. At the moment, i'm just creating an A record for every services pointing to the same IP and use NPM to redirect them to the correct port/service. So it looks like jellyfin.domain.com, this.domain.com, than.domain.com... I'm sure there is an easier way ? Using a wildcard maybe ? And having NPM doing the redirection ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[to preface i am a complete noob when it comes to networking and frankly i'm amazed that I have reached even this point of getting my jellyfin server to function.
 Ok so what i would really like to do is to share my jellyfin server library to friends and family without having them to type in my local ip address apparently that isnt safe and somehow my overseas friend is unable to access even if he enters my local ip address to the search bar.
 what i have now is my jellyfin server and a domain name that i bought from domain.com which seems to already come with the letsencrypt SSL thing is that really the case?
 From what i can tell from researching online there is a whole thing about using Caddy, Xampp, Apache etc which is all very confusing and im unable to make heads or tails about it.
 I would like help to know if there is any resource that clearly shows the steps i need to set up a reverse proxy for the specific use case that i would like to achieve. And even then is reverse proxy even what i need for this case or there is another workaround of redirecting localhost to my domain name?

I have successfully setup my Rpi4 as a Wireguard server with Pihole also installed. I have created a few clients and all can connect to the pi no problem. Here’s the issue I'm having trouble with- I have a Synology server I’m trying to setup for external connection ONLY through the PiVPn. I bought a USB-Ethernet adapter and plugged the Syno into it (the Pi) but I cannot connect to it when I do, not even locally. I would like to disable Syno’s quickconnect as it’s a security hole and I want to shut any ports that are not absolutely necessary. How can I utilize the Pi as a VPN gateway to the NAS as a client? (Before anyone asks why I didn't just use the Syno as a VPN server- I had the Pi and wanted to make good use of it as well as PiHole) 
 Thanks so much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK... I self hosted lots of media services, but I have the idea that choice can be a downside. For the older gang here... remember just turning on the TV at 1am when you got home from a night out and discovering an amazing new random film or when you are stuck at home sick watching bad daytime TV because their was no choice?!
 So here is the idea.. I have lots of content (have actually collected lots of bad TV, old commercials, great shows etc) and I would like to simulate TV channels from different places and times (currently have content for channels for "usa 80's" "USA early 90's" "UK 80's" and "soviet block early 70's")
 Wanted to ask you guys if you had ideas about setup... I can set this up, but most options seem like a pain!
 In a perfect world (perhaps asking too much!) - docker container - web interface - feed it a m3u or manage it inside? - able to do multiple streams 
 Even something that piggyback on jellyfin or plex?
 Any ideas?

 I still very new to all this but I am learning every day from all of you.
 Is anyone currently running vaultwarden with nginx proxy manager to manage the route to it and the cert?
 Just looking for a way to set it up. I believe if I set NPM up to use http and port 80 I can get a cert and it seems to work. I'm just wondering if that's the most secure way to run it.
 Previously I was running it using the docker compose documentation on vaultwarden wiki with Caddy for cert management almost exactly the way the documentation suggests. But I wanted to use NPM to point to some other VMs so I had to forward firewall ports 80 and 443 to that VM.
 Thanks for any help you can provide. Sorry if any of my terminology is incorrect!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently looking to upgrade from my tiny Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB Plex server so that I can scale to more powerful virtual servers and to switch over my costly cloud VPS services since seeing people on YouTube use VMWARE’s ESXI so that the server acts just like a virtual machine (NetworkChuck). 
 Mostly what I plan on running, a few servers, some on and off: 
  
Minecraft
 Terraria
 Wordpress
 Valheim (maybe… it gets a little demanding after a while)
 Vaultwarden
 Few other small things
  
I don’t want to spend too much (less than 600) but I am willing to spend a little more money if it would make a difference.
 Features I’m looking for:
  
Easily removable drives
 Ethernet (of course)
 64GB ram if possible
 An above average CPU
 Maybe put a little graphics card when I want so I can run plex arcade
  
This looks good to me
 I am looking for a server to slowly remove all the VPSs that I constantly pay for and want to go full self host since I am able to manage them on my own. I just can’t find the right specs and value, if anyone has a few in mind that would help.
 I am educated with the command line but not with ESXI or home/virtual server management. Yes I am looking to run multiple different operating systems and I prefer Ubuntu server.

 I'm thinking about renting a dedicated server at Hetzner. I can rent it Germany for 47 euros a month, but in Finland it costs 41 euros a month. 
 I think it is a lot of money but I think I'm able to do it and I really like all the things I can do if I have a dedicated server. 
 ​
 Now, I have used iperf to test the internet connection. When my PC is the client I get about 10Mbit per second (my upload speed at home) with both servers in Germany and Finland. If my PC is the server, and I try iperf on a server in Germany as client I get 75Mbit per second (my download speed at home). If I try the server in Finland as client I get about 60Mbit per second, about 20% less when trying from Germany.
 The ping is 20ms to Germany but 40ms to Finland.
 ​
 I want to host things like, OpenVPN, PiHole, Bitwarden and much more on dedicated server. Basically I want to connect to the VPN server all the time, when I am at home or traveling or work. 
 Should I go with more expensive but closer internet connection or less expensive but a bit slower internet connection?
 I would like to go with the cheapest. Since I'm the only user on the dedicated server anyway. Does it matter so much I get a little bit lower bandwidth and a little bit higher ping???

 i would like to switch from my current postfix/dovecot/rspamd installation to mailcow. the domain should stay the same, maybe the ip address can stay the same too. What is the best option to migrate as smoothly as possible? I have 4 active email accounts on the server, all are in a maildir format and are stored under home of the respective user (eg. home/user/Maildir)
 I would keep the downtime as low as possible and migrate all mails to Mailcow.
 There's some kind of guide, but I'm unsure if it 'really' works:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 With the recent google photos change I've decided that it might be a good time to upgrade my plex server in order to also host a service like Photoprism. The issue is that I'm currently running my plex server on an Alienware X51-R2, which is still running really well, but doesn't have room in the case/motherboard to add more drives and it's likely an absolute pain to transfer the system to a new case and upgrade to a new motherboard. 
 So the question I have for you guys is: what would you recommend I do? Should I buy a raid enclosure, external drives, or some other way to extend my storage on my Alienware X51-R2 or should I try to instead buy something like a Synology Nas?
 Some quick system details:
  
i5-3330
 8 GB of Ram
 GeForce GT 640
 1 TB hard drive

 My domain is on NameCheap, so I downloaded and installed their DDNS Client v2 and configured everything.
 When trying to access the proxied port(80), it just won't load. Like literally, my Firefox says that there's a problem with loading the page.
 I have tried messing around with my firewall but still nothing. I have opened a thread on Caddy's official forum. Sadly no progress yet.

I can access the Web UI from my home network using 192.168.0.x and through the VMs at the lan address. In order to access the lan side of pfSense from my home network I set up a static route in my PC setting up the WAN pfSense address as a gateway. It doesn't work. I'm sure is a "dumb" question, but I really haven't got a clue. Any help? Love you people!

Since a while they have a restriction of 2 devices per (free) account and the fact I'm not hosting it myself makes me wonder if there is a (good) alternative? I will need Windows/Mac clients and iOS. Android support is a plus but not needed now. An export/import function would also be great. Saves me a lot of work... Browser plugin a big plus as well!
 Is there anything out there that does the job as good as Evernote?

 I'd like to do the same for when people are inside my house, using my wifi. 
 That means restricting the access to my wifi to devices by using a certificate. And also enforcing some security on the device. E.g. 6 digits code, absence of some specific apps, etc. 
 Do you guys know how to do this ?
 Edit: no proprietary software please :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a windows machine and a openvpn server (vpn). I need to make a static route to force all traffic only through the VPN so if the VPN drops, my IP is not leaked.
 Ive done this before but using a third party VPN and softether on the windows machine to connect. I would remove the default 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.1 route, and create a persistent route to the VPN. When I connect to the VPN, it auto-updates my routing table so my default route goes through the VPN tunnel, and when I turn off the VPN, all traffic ends.
 Unforutnley I cant replicate this for OpenVPN, even after creating a default route to the OpenVPN IP, as well as the tunnel IP it assigns me, it still wont connect. I am unable to establish a connection unless the default 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.1 route is active (which I could remove afterwards, but this is a hassle and a leak if I forget)
 So why cant static default routes be made to the OpenVPN server, despite working with other VPN providers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all. So this started out as a small project, but it ended up being waaay more complicated than I thought it was going to be. I cracked the screen on my Pixel 4a and I found out it was gonna cost $230 to repair. You know what I can buy for $230? Another phone. I def downgraded, but I don't use my phone for much. So then I had this Pixel 4a that wasn't even a year old that Amazon was going to pay me $20-60 for. 
 I really just wanted to wipe it and put Linux on it, but apparently that's not actually a thing I can do like I can with a computer. And 4a isn't ported to Ubuntu Touch yet. So I came across Linux Deploy. I've been needing to setup a backup server anyway.
 ANYWAY, this ended up becoming a whole thing because I had to find a work around for just about everything (because of chroot/Android/aarch64/etc.....). And I did! I even got it working with external storage and LVM!! I posted a tutorial on everything (split into two parts, because it gets hairy and LVM is optional). This is Debian in chroot running UrBackup. This project isn't for everyone, especially because you're limited to EXT4 and it only works with Windows and Linux clients (no Mac).
 But if you have an Android phone sitting around and you need a backup server, you can give it a swing:
 https://www.hannahtech.co/post/turn-your-old-cracked-android-phone-into-a-backup-server-urbackup-linux-deploy-tutorial-part-i
 The biggest con is that you are, at the end of the day, still running Android. You can disable most services and apps, but if you're paranoid about Big Brother Google, this probably isn't for you.

 Working
  
qBittorrent web ui is accessible from other PCs, and can successfully download Linux ISOs.
  
Not Working
  
qBittorrent refuses to change the username/password from admin.
 I want to use filebrowser to access the torrented files via HTTP, but it refuses to run at all on the RPi. I think I got the armv7 build to run once, but after trying to install it as a service the way I did with qBittorrent, it crashes no matter how or where I run it.
 Though it felt like better practice to open the programs to Localhost and then proxy them to LAN subdomains using a server, I couldn't figure out Caddy which supposedly would have made this easy
  
To do - Possibly Wireguard remote access in the future? I found a pretty good guide
 Any help or suggestions, particularly with getting Filebrowser (or an alternative) to run would be appreciated!
 Many thanks!

 - Could I use a pi2 to self host it?
 - A free hosting service could be good? (Maybe I could get some type of financiation or ads?)
 ​
 *I have a static public IP
 *Pi2 is the only energy-efficient computer
 *Maybe I could have it 24/7
 *I don’t know anyway to hide my ip 
 *I don’t need to be in a search engine, as I can give the address to every class
 *Security is a must for my self hosted idea
 *I can get a SIM card with mobile data and host from there despite not being recommended 
 I won’t be hosting big files, just pdfs or images. Most of the contents would be linked to external pages (with permission from the author) Using ads won’t be bad I think (I’m a student so I won’t put ads that could distract people) but the ads should be 100% customisable (size, place And content?)
 Thanks again! You guys are the best community

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, it's my first post, so please be gentle. 
 I have a domain name called exampledomain.com that I would like to host a website on and ensure it's encrypted etc using SSL. I'm hosting the website on godaddy at the moment.
 I also have another web server at home that I'd like to expose to the internet securely with SSL. I'd like this address to be store.exampledomain.com
 in GoDaddy's DNS, I have an A record for store that points to my router at home.
 When it comes to SSL certificates, I'm confused how to implement this for both websites and more specifically, what type of cert I'll need. Or will I need two certificates? I currently have a SAN cert with up to 5 SAN's from godaddy.
 Generally, you need to submit a CSR to generate the cert from the server the website is on. So I do this on the server where exampledomain.com sits, then upload the CSR to godaddy and voila; I get my cert.
 However, now I want a cert for store.exampledomain.com so I need to go to my server at home hosting the website and generate a CSR for store. Is it just a matter of rekeying the certificate in GoDaddy now? Will that break the existing certificate for exampledomain.com?
 Any resources you could share that might educate me further would be helpful, also.
 So confused, eager to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently migrated from a custom built mergerfs on ubuntu system to a Synology device. Whether this is an upgrade or not is in question, but I wanted a level of redundancy, a nicer heat solution and something which would just work so I didn't have to worry about storage when selfhosting. 
 I've been using NFS for a while, with user accounts stored in AD. Pre-synology it worked great; realm join and we're off and running. NFS with sec=sys worked wonders because each user had the same uid/gid everywhere.
 My primary use cases are 2 docker hosts. I'd mount the nfs share on each host, then each container runs as a set user and only has access to their own directories. It's magic. One mount and the rest takes care of itself.
 In this new synology world, it's not as easy. It generates different uids than everything else on the network so sec=sys doesn't work. I had a stab at nfs idmapping and it doesn't seem to work. Google is a mixed bag but the consensus is this isn't the answer (and may even be a synology quirk).
 The answer seems to be either; 
  
chmod -R 777
 manage uids manually (ergh...)
 kerberos
 samba
  
I'm new to kerberos but I think I'm beginning to slowly get it. Is it worth it? 
 Kerberos & Samba also may mean I need to manually mount each share under different user accounts. This feels cleaner but a relative pain in the arse.

 I've made a small script to easily get you started with LinuxServer.io applications using docker-compose. I personally find it very useful to quickly install an application and try it out. Hopefully it will help you too.
 The script getlsioapp.sh allows you to install a LinuxServer.io application in less than 10 seconds. It will automatically create the necessary volume directories on the host and automatically create the correct docker-compose configuration file. The docker-compose configuration file includes a description of all environment variables, volume- and port mappings.
 More info here.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a few things running beind nginx proxy manager and they all work because the basic http(s)://IP:port request locally auto loads the desired location. For example, my nextcloud instance loads /index.php/login.
 I just installed an app (azuracast after reading the other thread), but the way that works is http(s)://x.x.x.x:port loads /login or /dashboard if you are logged in. Thats the admin dashboard but I am trying to expose the "public" page which is:
 http(s)://x.x.x.x:port/public/stationName 
 And the port is the same for the management dashboard. 
 Anyone know how to accomplish that with nginx proxy manager? When trying to use the custom locations setting I still just get directed to the main management page. nginx conf here https://pastebin.com/raw/rKM6kB3F

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an account for the oracle free tier, and I've been using one of the hosts to only host a teamspeak server, nothing else. I had the server running for almost a year, with no issues, until I started getting emails about abuse warning with the following message:
 Oracle has received notice of or detected unusual and potentially harmful activity originating from the indicated resource in your tenancy.
 Traffic Details: Outbound Port Scanning, Brute-forcing, Web Exploitation, and/or DDoS 
 I unfortunately do not have a support subscription, so I am unable to log a ticket to inquire about it. 
 I've tried some of the basic security controls they suggest like making sure OS is up to date, disable password login, change ssh port. I also installed sshguard and fail2ban to help make sure my machine is more secure.
 They have since disabled the host, but I am able to clone the boot volume and then make a new instance from that clone to still have my vm, but then it's around a week or two until it gets disabled and I have to repeat this.
 I have no idea where to start looking or what to do to address this issue? I would greatly appreciate if anyone has any advice or help on what I can do to resolve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have all of my domains on GoDaddy (not my original choice but it works for everything else so I am not interested in switching) and their Ultimate Linux Hosting package which includes cPanel and SSH access as well as the regular GoDaddy management tools. 
 I have a few subdomains that I use for things like Nextcloud, Gitea, etc. that I host on a server in my basement.
 When I try to issue an SSL cert using Let's Encrypt, I have to issue it on GoDaddy and then have to install the certs through cPanel, and then copy those certs from cPanel to my server for HTTPS to work. When I try to issue the certs directly on my server, HTTPS does not work. Basically this is the breakdown:
  
SSH into cPanel.
 
Run acme.sh and create the cert.
 
Copy the cert information to the SSL manager in cPanel.
 
Copy those same certs to my SSL folder on my server at home.
 
Update my home webserver's vhost config to point to the correct server.
 
SSL is now set up and HTTPS should be working correctly. Repeat steps 1-4 to update the cert.
 
 Is this behavior correct or am I doing something wrong? I have an A record in my GoDaddy DNS for each subdomain (nextcloud.domain.tld, git.domain.tld) and don't have any files on GoDaddy itself; if I were to shut off my port forward you wouldn't see anything at all. Yet the SSL certs have to be managed through cPanel first, then copied to my webserver for https to work.

Right now, after the new docker images are pushed to docker hub, I still need to manually SSH into the RPI and use docker-compose to pull and run the containers again.
 My question is: how can I "trigger" my RPI to auto pull the new images (and run the containers again) after gihub actions pushes to docker hub?
 PS: I've heard of watchtower, and while that does work, it's not exactly what I'm looking for. Since it runs on a schedule, it doesn't update the images right after they're pushed to docker hub. Also, I'm aware that docker has put on some limits to pulls/day for free users, so that would make the watchtower rollouts even slower.
 Sorry for the somewhat long post, and thanks in advance!

 I am looking for a foss alternative to google photos. I would prefer it to have a webapp or apps for Mac, android, iOS, windows- almost everything. I also want the app to function as a gallery app, much like google photos on Android. 
 The main feature I am looking for is for Ai face, thing, and place recognition. With pretrained models or self training. (So if it doesn't recognize something I could teach it to with pictures.)
 A lot of the ones I have been looking for don't have the ai feature, which really makes me exit the tab.
 Comment if you find/know of any software like this.
 Thanks!

 so recently I asked myself how you build these binary files files for full stack applications.
 Take Plex as an example, if you go on their website you can download a server file as an binary compatible with your system (.exe, .dmg, .sh, etc), which includes the webversion of Plex and the whole backend. So I was wondering how you are able to do that, since it will probably also help with building single docker images instead of stacks which I currently use to combine frontend and backend. 
 Does anyone know how its done or know an open source example for the building process?
 Thanks for the help!

 - Logged in users can access the form, fill out the fields, place signature, upload pictures.
 - Make fields manditory and non-manditory
 - A review feature, which allows a user to view all entered data
 - Place two signature fields at the end, after data is reviewed
 - Also allows sending the form to an external user (anonymous user, will not log in, so needs a unique URL), the pre-filled form including one of the signatures should be visible (non-editable), and only allow the second signature to be placed.
 - Logged in users can see the previously filled out forms, edit and resubmit the form/save it
 - Completed forms can be sent to a mailbox in PDF format
 - The anonymous user can fill out an email address at the end of the form, to be able to send the PDF to an extra email address (his own, or the site manager for example)
 - There is a format in which we'd like to make the PDF where the different entered fields can be replaced, I can build it in JS/PHP and also have a Word format.
 The software is used to make work reports after a days work on site, and requires a signature of the worker and the project manager on site. The project manager sometimes needs to review, hence the email-review-feature.
 I've tried DocAssemble, which got me really far, but the last few steps (including reviewing, sending email and returning to the form without having a user to log in) I wasn't able to accomplish, even with some help from the community there, I do use DocAssemble for other forms, I do love the flexibility of it.
 ​
 Any help, opinions and pointers in a direction would be greatly appreciated!

 Client: Windows in VM
 VPN: OPENVPN
 I delete the 0.0.0.0 route in the client. I make a route for the destination of my VPN server with my LAN default gateway as the gateway (192.168.1.1). So, in practice when I turn on openvpn, it attempts to connect to the server IP which has a route through my local LAN gateway, which would result in a connection and a new VPN connection established. And when the VPN connection drops, all traffic stops.
 However, I am unable to connect to the VPN server. I can ping it though. I was able to replicate the same scenario in a windows VM with softether client and a third party VPN and can connect successfully. What am I doing wrong?

UPDATE: I now have this working. When you are proxying a single host the cloudflared daemon creates the DNS entries for you. When you are using a config file you must create the DNS entries manually. You can either do this at cloudflare.com or use the command line:

 Here is the documentation I missed. Hopefully my mistake means that somebody else gets it easy. :-) 
 UPDATE 2: SSH access is a little more complicated as there is no port 22 available on CloudFlare and you can't get to the Docker host via ssh://localhsot:22 from inside a container. There are actually good docs on how to do this, I just missed them.

 It is working now or should I say I was able to dump all the the Joplin files into its own directory. I tried this at first before posting, but it didn't work. I might have typo'd url. Anyways, thanks for the folks who suggested it.

 In protonmail can I do (imagine) 100 alias to the email or I need to pay more than the plus?
 Is the whois privacy safe? Or do i need to cheat in the real information?
 I've seen that some people get their domain hijacked by a company, is that easy to do with every domains? I'll be getting a .me
 Is the only "disadvantage" is that we always have to pay it?

 I'm pissed off about StandardNotes' new syncing server. It now requires Docker ( I use LXC) and it spawns 7 different containers just so that I can sync some notes between my laptop and my phone. I was wondering if there are other selfhosted alternatives that I can switch over to.
 Here are my requirements for such platform:
  
Encrypted notes/storage
 MacOS/Windows app and native Android/iOS app
 Built-in ability to keep the notes synced, ideally without having to set up another service to do this (like nextcloud, webdav, etc.)

 Any recommendations are highly appreciated.

 In my limited free time, I play around in a homelab for the learning experience, love of the game, etc. I'm trying to migrate away from Docker in favor of deploying web servers & services on virtualized 'bare metal' ;).
 To summarize:
  
Homelab: 1 WAN IP
 VM #1: Docker host, LetsEncrypt (aka SWAG) as my reverse proxy
 VM #2: NextCloud host via LEMP Stack (nginx)
 etc...
  
What I want to do:
  
Keep VM#1 UP: my 'production' reverse proxy (Existing NGiNX/LetsEncrypt, which I use heavily) 
 
Create additional 'web servers' as if VM#1 didn't exist:
  
Multiple NGiNX/Apache instances
 Allow certbot/letsencrypt packages to act on their own, as if my production instance wasn't in effect.
 
  
IE: My NextCloud VM. I want to run certbot/letsencrypt to acquire it's own SSL certificate, but I'm not sure how that would work. 
 Would a simple proxy_pass without SSL to the test VM's do it? I want to be sure before moving forward. 
 Is this possible? 
  
If so, any tips or pointers are welcome! 
 If I'm not making sense, I welcome the ridicule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks!
 I have been trying to learn/figure out how I can self-host at home, I do that that I'm stuck behind CGNAT, so after following this sub I felt like the way to go would be VPS (Wireguard Server) --> RaspberryPi (Wireguard Client) and then run Nginx Proxy Manager on the client. I've been trying to follow the materials here:
  
https://www.selfhosted.pro/hl/wireguard_vps/
 https://forums.lawrencesystems.com/t/getting-started-building-your-own-wireguard-vpn-server/7425
  
Along with various other googling and trials and error :) 
 But it feels like I must be missing some step with either the Wireguard or Nginx setup.
 For initial testing, I was trying to connect to my domain (tied to the VPS) and then use that domain within Nginx Proxy Manager, however, when I put the domain in I can get to the Nginx Proxy Manager Default page but can never get anything else to work.
 Any help is appreciated.

 From testing its super easy to setup and use, providing I can protect the nextcloud interface with relevant brute force protection then I am just looking for security advice from the tunnelling point of view.
 How secure would this method be for connecting to a NAS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I'm new to self-hosting so please correct me if I make any mistakes here.
 I'm looking into buying some hardware to host some tools on, and I'm here looking for some recommendations on what kind of specs I need to look for in a server.
 Initially I'm going to look into setting up a matrix synapse instance to bridge to slack, fb messenger and discord, and a system for SMS forwarding. Assuming that goes to plan, I would then like to expand to an implementation of Mycroft.ai and a couple of CCTV cameras and door open / glass break sensors for home security on the same server.
 Although I will go with the most cost efficient method to achieve these goals, I want to have plenty of scope to get all this up and running smoothly, so price and energy requirements aren't of particular concern. What sort of devices should I be looking into? A single server dealing with all of it, an array of raspberry pis, would I be better off hiring a VPS, etc? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm wondering if anyone here has been able to create some cool seamless design across all their apps.
 This because I see that everyone share their custom, personal dashboards, with some really good eye candy, but they lack into do the same with apps.
 One big advantage about self hosting is that almost every piece of software is web software, allowing us to modify the look with some custom HTML/CSS and even JavaScript without the needed of compiling.
 So if you take care of the eye candy of your apps, I would be happy to see any of your configs, so feel free to share a picture of that. :D
 Peace.

I want to create a static route so all internet traffic only flows through the VPN, and nothing else. Ive been able to do this with softether and a third-party VPN service, but I cant get it to work with OpenVPN. 
 Id delete the 0.0.0.0 route. Then I would make a route in cmd with the destination network my VPN and the gateway my local LAN gateway ie: route add [VPN IP] mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.1. Id connect to my VPN using softether client, which populates a IPV4 address and default gateway for my VPN adaptor, and in turn generates a route for all traffic to flow through this VPN adaptor, the route shows as: 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [VPN gateway] [VPN interface]. 
 Trying to replicate this procedure, but with openvpn server and open client I am unable to connect. Note: I am able to connect if I reset the routing table, but this defeats the purpose as I want all traffic to only go through the VPN's IP.

 I was wondering if anyone had some insight on doing a self-hosted version?
 I'm not all that familiar myself with building Docker images - maybe it's my own fault for relying on this too much. But what I'm after is perhaps hosting my projects on a self hosted Git server (Gitea maybe?) then when that's updated, it gets built and pushed to a self hosted repo.

A few years ago I switched to Digital Ocean as a VPS to reduce deliverability issues, recently the IP block I was in got blacklisted by zen.spamhaus. Given that I have often suggested people use a SMTP relay I though I would share my experience of not being the target customer any more. They used to advertise SMTP relays as what they are, a relay service, they no longer do that. Now as a selfhoster I felt like a square peg in a round hole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone,
 Learning lots from this sub, and hoping to pay it forward in the future. Unfortunately I’m here with a dumb question instead regarding self hosting my apps.
 Let’s say my docker container is running all my apps and is on 192.169.1.1 It’s my understanding that the only way to expose these services outside my network is by forwarding port 80 to that IP in my router settings, correct? Is there any other way? I ask because I don’t want to do this, and just want a little piece of mind after all this tinkering. 
 I can’t access them from outside my network that I know of, however, I’m running ssl on all of them so technically am I not exposing them somewhat by navigating to something like photoprism.mydomain.com?
 Thanks for any help,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The situation is as follows:
 I have a MediaWiki installed on a Debian server. The Wiki is installed on Apache2
 For information, the changes I made in the LocalSettings.php file is as follows:
 $wgScriptPath = "/mediawiki"; $wgServer = "http://192.168.100.5:8080";
 In the internal network, when I type in the local IP address of the MediaWiki server (192.168.100.5:8080) I get to the default page of Apache where it says that it works.
 But when I type /mediawiki behind it, (192.168.100.5:8080/mediawiki), I get to the main page of the Wiki.
 I have put this server behind a reverse proxy (Caddy) so that it's accessible from the outside world. 
 The Caddyfile config is as follows:
 mydomain.com:443 { reverse_proxy 192.168.100.5:8080 }
 But when I type in the domain, I can only see the Apache Default page. I also can not get to the MediaWiki if I put /mediawiki behind the URL.
 Does anyone know how I can make it so that whenever I go to my domain, that it automatically goes to the main page of the MediaWiki, (which in the local network would be 192.168.100.5:8080/mediawiki as stated earlier). Or does anyone know where I should look? Any help is appreciated.
 Thank you so much in advance!

I've looked into Pebblehost but I saw that it's virtual and that I might have to use terminal, which I'm not sure about; I'm used to windows and its simplicity, however I don't know where to start with hosting and the thought of using Linux frightens me (lol). Can anyone recommend me a good service to use or reassure me that I would be able to use Pebblehost? Either will work lmao, thanks for reading I guess
 TL;DR need server help pls Pebblehost scary Apex overpriced need server 24/7 for friends

 I'm setting up my ebook server. I decided to use calibre-web - https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web as a docker container and to be honest, it confuses me a lot. Documentation is not very good so I decided to ask more experienced self hosters about a few things.
 Is it just gui for browsing ebooks? I cannot find any "add" button, so I'm not sure if it is supposed to work similar to regular calibre, or is it just browsing frontend? How can I add new book? Should I also have calibre in parallel, that will use the same database as calibre-web from the mentioned above git repository?
 Second question? Is it possible to host audiobooks with calibre-web?

 Today i installed Heimdall, because it looked nice and i wanted a quick way to access all my selfhosted apps.
 But after the installation (docker) i wanted to add an app and i've seen in a few youtube videos, that heimdall is suggesting names if you type in the application name and also does create cards for supported apps.
 But this does not work somehow.
 For example i wanted to add plex, so i type in plex in application name and from what i have seen is that i should suggest "Plex" from a dropdown list and also create an card for plex automatically, because it is an supported app (Checked on apps.heimdall.site)
 I also tried the "update app list" button a few times, but didn't work and after that i download the Plex.zip from the heimdall-apps github site manually and unzipped it to config/www/supported apps, but nothing did work as expected.
 ​
 Do i miss anything?
 Hope someone can help me :)

 I am searching for something capable of monitoring a web page, but in a "smart" way. When I monitor this page manually, I need to click to a couple of buttons in order to know if there have been any changes (in my case, if there is any disponibility of this certain product). For this reason, I cannot use extensions like "Refresh & Monitor", because I would need the tool to perform these actions before checking if a certain line of text appeared. Also, I would need this tool to have very short checking intervals, like no more than 5 seconds. Any ideas?

I was wondering, what are your strategies to mitigate egress data transfer costs?
 
Also, does anyone know if there exists some kind of firewall that I can install on my servers so that it would keep an eye on the egress data transfer and cap outward bandwidth down to a fixed Mbps amount after a limit (say 1TB out) has been reached?
 
 Motivation
 Hi guys, I am a 4th year Software Eng student and in the last couple of years I've been researching and learning about cloud technologies and services. It seems to me that cloud computing and data storage are relatively cheap, or at least you can find ways to mitigate the costs (e.g. spot instances, S3 storage classes etc..). On the other hand egress data transfer costs really bug me:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently been looking for a SOHO document management system that can OCR and index PDFs. 
 I used to use PaperPort (came free with a scanner a lifetime ago) and was very happy with everything except remote access and the need to keep a PC running to host it.
 I’ve since moved through Googledrive, OneDrive and Owncloud and have yet to find something that works as well for me as PaperPort did. 
 Ideally I’d like something that can run on a Synology NAS, has a good web GUI and supports mobile devices as clients (the wife has an iPhone 12 and a Samsung tablet). I need to maintain an offsite backup copy (I have a synology ds1515+ and a ds713+ with ds513 that makes it the same size as the ds1515+ for local backups) and am happy to use a VPS for snapshots etc in case of ransomware. 
 My primary need is to scan to PDF and have those PDFs OCR’d and indexed so I can easily find and print anything I need. Add to that things like PDF downloads such as MagPI and HackSpace magazines and manuals for everything I own and it becomes a complete repository with no need for a nay paper files. 
 Do you do anything like this for your documents and what do you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone know of any good, open source solutions for a DNS server which has a nice, decent, intuitive WebUI for DNS management? Something similar to the way CloudFlare works? Ive been meaning to testout DNS Manager from ISP manager . Windows doesn't have an HTML version of DNS server yet does it? (I know said open source but just curious).
 Alternatively, and maybe I'm misunderstanding this, but maybe an IPAM solution would be good too. Is IPAM where I manage my IPs/DHCP and DNS all in one? I always find it tedious and annoying AF to have to make a static DHCP reservation and then create a second DNS record with the ZeroShell Router i have. Would be sweet to have it all bundled together since IP address management and DNS are so tied together at the end of the day,
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<rant> Literally how!? I've read about a lot of people using docker to run containers and storing all the big data on a NAS. While I run into endless problems trying to do this.
 Sure, apps that need read-only access (Plex/Jellyfin) have no problem. I add the NAS mount on the host and then bind mount the media folder into docker. No problem.
 But what about web apps that wants to write data? Nextcloud, WebDAV, etc.
 They start up and throw a fit that they couldn't chown everything under the sun:
 chown: /var/lib/dav/data: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav/data: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav/DavLock: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav: Operation not permitted
 chown: /var/lib/dav: Operation not permitted
 I've tried with NFS and CIFS, simple permissions, POSIX permissions, matching accounts, UIDs...
 </rant>
 I think my permissions are OK becuase I see that the app created a whole bunch of files in the NAS directory, but I guess couldn't chown them. 
 Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a newbie to Sonarr so apologies if there's supposed to be an easy fix. I tried google and the FAQ section but none of them seemed to help.
 So I have a linux host and a linux server (which is basically just an old laptop running Arch without a GUI). I've installed sonarr on the server, and the host machine can load the sonarr webpage though my local network. However, when I try to download a show, I need to add a download path and it only displays my host filesystem. I want to download shows to my server, but don't see an option for that even though both Sonarr and the webpage are hosted on the server.
 Also when I go to the Sonarr settings page, I can see that my server hard drive under Disk Space. I'm not sure why it doesn't give me the option to save to it.

 What are your opinions and where can I find more information?

 Thought I'd share my most recent creation: autodockerdash
 ​
 https://reddit.com/link/o1581t/video/azamirmjsm571/player
 It started as a little dashboard project, which is something I want this to grow into, but for now, it just displays docker container statuses.
 It's a simple server that will connect to your docker socket, get some stats on the containers, and if they have some specific labels, will display them on the dashboard. Includes the ability to display dependent "child" containers, useful to make sure that your app is running if it needs to include a DB etc.
 https://github.com/Inlustra/auto-docker-dash
 It's a little heavy handed and hasn't been tested super-well. It will auto update in the background using websockets though it is a server side rendered SPA, so you don't *need* Javascript.
 If you have any feature requests or comments, let me know or post on the github repo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I created a OpenVPN server using Oracle cloud. They have a marketplace image of OpenVPN and it creates a Oracle Ubuntu instance with OpenVPS installed. During the creation process it asks for my public key so I create one using PuttyGEN and copy / paste actually as shown (its RSA 2048 bit) and I was able to create the VPS succssfully. 
 Then with putty I attach the private key, and enter my username (ubuntu) and VPS IP to SSH in. I get the error message "putty error: PuTTY Fatal Errror. No supported authentication methods available ( server sesnt: publickey) " 
 I am following these guides exactly:
 https://k21academy.com/1z0-932/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-pair-for-oracle-cloud-windows-linux/
 https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/launching-your-own-free-private-vpn-in-the-oracle-cloud 
 Any idea what I am doing wrong? I have repeated the entire process almost 12 times now and the issue remains. 
 Note: The oracle blog link is outdated, the instance creation is different now then the images shown. In the blog it shows an option to generate SSH keys during the instance creation process, but this is not present when I create my instance, it only asks to enter my public SSH key (optional), which is why im using PuTTYGEN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am trying to host synapse server and use nginx as a reverse-proxy server.
  
The synapse server is running fine and is accessible when I use localhost:8008. Note, 8008 port is used for the synapse server.
 The nginx server is running fine locally as I can access localhost , also using the internet as I can access my domain server www.mydomain.com .
  
I have setup nginx config in the following way
 location /matrix { proxy_pass http://localhost:8008/; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; client_max_body_size 2000M; } 
 to access the synapse server when I use www.mydomain.com/matrix.
 Now, the problem is when I use www.mydomain.com/matrix, my url in the address bar becomes www.mydomain.com/_matrix/static and gives 404 error (page does not exit).
 ​
 I think I need to change "webroot" somewhere either in the homeserver.yml Or nginx.conf to redirect url to the right local synapse server.
 ​
 Any help will be appreciated.
 Thanks

 I followed this tutorial, which launches a docker image using this command :
 sudo docker run \ --name=heimdall \ -e PUID=1001 \ -e PGID=1001 \ -e TZ=America/New_York \ -p 7888:80 \ -p 4443:443 \ -v ~/.config/heimdall/:/config \ --restart unless-stopped \ linuxserver/heimdall 
 Now it's running, but I didn't have to set up a .yml file and don't know if it's wrong to do so. 
 From what I understand it is used to configure easily the container, so now I can't do so because I don't know where the yml is...
 I am also trying to install PiHole but don't know how to, using a yml.
 Can you explain how it works, or how I should do ?
 Thanks

 I've just released the first version of my new inventory system to help anyone who needs to track "stuff" log where it is and how much they have of it.
 You can download the source from https://github.com/proffalken/mventory and there are docker containers for AMD64, ARMv6, ARMv7, and ARM64 so it should run on just about any hardware.
 It's entirely API-driven, although you can use the Django Admin interface if you want a GUI for adding components, and at the moment it just lists items by location - search will be coming soon.
 I'm hoping to integrate it with octopart in future as well, and I'd love other people to get involved even if it's writing a GUI in another language that talks to the API!
 Let me know what you think!

 I have a brick and mortar store, and we're doing some local delivery based on calls. I wanted to expand this to online, and see what is available. Most sites like shopify have plugins that allow for easy local delivery management (like this: Local Delivery ). I'm trying to find a similar solution but self-hosted. Does anyone know of a plugin for any self-hosted platform that can help manage this? I haven't decided on any single ecommerce platform just yet, mainly because I want to find the best option for this problem in particular.
 Basically just looking for scheduling deliveries based on customer location!

 I self host nearly all the services my community uses (except email). 
 I am going to start adding - cameras (5-8) - wind sensors (3-5) - temperature and humidity sensors (10-15) - liquid level sensors (5-8) - batteries connected to solar panels (5-8)
 And or course I will want to gather in real time data from those devices and to store them on my linux server. 
 Is there an open "communication standard" i should look for when buying these sensors, to make sure I will be able to poll them and integrate everything in my database ?
 Is there a FOSS application server side that can use this protocol and display nice graphs ?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I live near a small airfield as well as an international airport. I use FlightRadar24 a lot as it is the most well refined but it always annoys me that I cannot see military aircraft flying over me on there. We also have classic fighter aircraft fly from my small airfield (jets and warbirds) and often FR24 also blocks those out.
 I have tried using ADSB Exchange but the coverage around here isn't perfect and the Web UI is a hot mess on mobile which makes using it rather unpleasant.
 I have a server rack, a VPN to my home setup as well as the radio kit I would need to host my own ADSB radar but I would like to know.
 Is there a way I can feed FR24 or 360 Radar/ADSB Exchange and my own personal radar view? It would be nice to help increase the spotty coverage in my area but I would also like a raw radar view of the data with no filtering of any aircraft. Is this possible?
 Either way what is the best radar view software to use for this kinda application? 
 I have an RTL-SDR (one of those USB TV stick things) and would like to pass it through to a VM in ESXi (if possible). It would be awesome if the ADSB radar was a 'server' that could be accessed by IP address through a browser.
 Any ideas, ive seen lots of great posts about ADSB but nothing that fully answered my questions.
 Many thanks!

 As I'm now well and truly self hosting all of my needs, I find myself wanting to tweak a thing of two from time to time while I'm in the office.
 I'm using zerotier where needed so as far as a VPN is concerned I'm not going to stand up WireGuard or anything else.
 I'd like to host a browser without needing to install a fully fledged OS like windows or Ubuntu desktop just so I can use Chrome.
 Is there any way to host a chrome, or other, browser ?
 Ideally I'd like to use my proxmox server to spin up a container that will host a web based browser.
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running multiple docker containers, for example nextcloud, monica, heimdall etc. So far they have all been running using http. I am now looking to use only https for all services. Everything is running on a private network and I use a VPN to connect from the outside. Therefore only private IPs are involved. For example to get to nextcloud I do:
 192.168.10.5:100
 for monica I use:
 192.168.10.5:105
 For heimdall I use
 192.168.10.5:80
 etc. same private IP, different port.
 ​
 I therefore need to use reverse proxy for all theses ports and use self signed certificates to get SSL. I am not interested in using letsencrypt, some DNS redirect etc. I want my setup as it is now but with HTTPS. So far when using nginx proxy manager I can get it to work on one service at a time, on port 80 only. I want to use it to listen to multiple different ports. I assume it is because it only listens on port 80 and 443. I have also tried using nextcloud.192.168.10.5 but that is not recognized as the same IP and therefore does not work. How to I use multiple ports with nginx proxy manager? I am using docker for everything

 https://pastebin.com/DQRniwfB
 ​
 This has been working fine, and for radarr, I was able to access via <server IP>:7878.
 However, now it seems like it is not forwading the 7878 from privoxyvpn to the host. nmap does not show this port.
 Nonetheless, I can `curl localhost:8989` from the host, and it reaches radarr. 
 Any thoughts why this suddenly stopped working?
 I have ruled out a firewall issue since other ports work. Only the ones that go through privoxyvpn don't

I'm thinking about buying "My Cloud Ex2 Ultra" with 2x4TB HDDs for 200eur. The stuff I'd be storing there wouldn't be critical and if it dies it would only inconvenience me. I'd like for my plex that's running on the laptop to be able to stream files off the nas. I know its shit NAS but it basicly costs same as bare HHDs and since I'm not gonna run any applications on it, I don't really care that its shit, right? Or should I just buy once and cry once and get something good?

 I am planning to build a home server mainly for my development activities (mostly backend server-side) and also in parallel want to explore the media server setups. I am very comfortable setting up machines from the scratch and learning new stuff. I am trying to put together a workstation/server machine that can help me with this hobby .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 So I am looking for a solid software for a non profit organization. This is what I need the software to be able to do:
  
Store membership details: name of member, chapter name, chapter location.
 Able to filter search results by chapter name, or city.
 Good organization of data, for example each city contains several chapters, each chapter contains several members. So city --> chapters within that city --> members within that chapter.
 Keep track of membership, no need to be able to process payment, but reminders or indicators preferred for membership fees every 1 year.
 Clear, simple and effective interface - we work with a lot of visually impaired people, so looking for someone that they would be able to use as well.
  
Some additional notes:
  
No need for website. This software is only going to be used by the admin team.
 Since it's a non profit organization, would love for the price to be reasonable. Not quite sure what the budget would be but will be happy with a reasonable price if the piece of software is good.
 The way I am kind of thinking about it is Microsoft Access, but more straightforward, modern and preferably on the cloud.
  
I would be happy to provide any more details or answer any questions. Thank you so much in advance for helping me out!

 I am running a bunch of containers on docker on my synology nas and two containers in particular and a few others are for network monitoring tools. In this scenario i am using wireshark and ntopng. When running the containers they are showing 172.17.0.1 as local. On this nas i have one router on lan 1 and another (Vpn) router on lan 2. How can i make it show it says lan 1 and it's devices (192.168.0.1) and lan 2 and it's devices (192.168.1.1) I suspect i will have an issue when i setup grafana and all that stuff. Would this have to be a macvlan? I access all my docker container's via my nas ip which follows lan 1 - 192.168.0.
 ​
 Thanks for any help!

 How do you handle your back-ups?
 Are there any backup solutions when self-hosting that you can just set up once and never have to worry about again (as long as nothing breaks, at least)?
 With the same "safety" as when using a subscription service, so the backups are not just on a separate drive in the same computer but at a completely different location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm new to all of this and the definitions of words and concepts are overwhelming. So when I googled "on-premises" sometimes it's required to have your server in your home/organisation but sometimes it's still" on-prem" if you rent a server as long as you're the one in charge over the software and the provider does not give you software and server as a whole.
 So if renting a server is allowed and running your bought software on it, isn't that IaaS? And if it really is IaaS, it would make no sense to say "on-premises vs. cloud" because IaaS is also a part of Cloud Computing. It seems to me that often cloud and SaaS are used synonymous.
 In addition, sometimes I read "on-premises software (self-hosting)" as it was the same. But for me, having your own server (rented or bought) is somewhat your "own cloud" at home. And that would contratdict the whole "on-premise vs. cloud" thing. But maybe this is a false understanding of the concept and for the last point, I see why "own cloud at home" is more a metaphor when acknowledging that Cloud Computing is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS and it's somehow weird to offer a service to oneself :-) 
 Thanks for reading

 Aprise is quite good for hooking multiple services but it doesn't have SMTP relay.

(Edit) Since ppl are asking about the type of attackers, look at it like this, government agencies are trying to take a site down or locate the owner in this case how would one best protect themselves. Isn't it a bit of a chicken and egg problem. As sites get taken down the project is forked elsewhere. At core what I'm asking is if rather than creating multiple proxies and making the system difficult to penetrate creating multiple forks of the site all hosted in different locations is the best choice??

I would need a mail server in every docker container seperately. I would highly appreciate a solution which i can integrate in my docker-compose setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I need help to configure my DNS on my domain.
 The situation:I have a domain and I created a DDNS entry, I used ddclient and everything is works fine now with the IP update and everything. However, I host 2 servers on my machine, until recently I had 2 different DDNS to the same IP and then an SRV Record that pointed to them for the servers to work.
 I want however to use only one DDNS IP and somehow use SRV records to point all my servers to that one. I however have little experience with all of that so I don't really understand how I am supposed to continue.
 Simply put, I have currently:
 cs.domain.com which points to my ipmc.domain.com which points to my IP again, andip.domain.com which again points to the same IP.
 my ddclient updates ip.domain.com regularly, but not the other two.
 my SRV records point one to the cs (cs._udp.domain.com) and one to the mc DDNS entries (mc._tcp.domain.com). I can easily fix the issue by just updating all 3 DDNS Entries, but I feel like there should be an easier solution.
 For further questions feel free to ask me, and thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to find a good modern book keeping / accounting solution for a UK based software startup.
 Basically, until now most of my accounting was running in spreadsheets, but I am seeking more automation, but ideally also want to be able to plug into HMRC (my company is all remote, but since you need to put a pin on a map somewhere, for us that is London). It should fulfil all requirements and I want to be able to have control over the data, but it should also be sitting on a modern platform, so I won't have to move everything again soon.Whilst access to compute resources won't be an issue (we're a software company), ease of use is: Right now we don't have any admin staff (yet). Where do I best start? Would invoice ninja be suitable or am I running into the wrong direction looking at that?
 I appreciate pointers that might help me or questions I should be asking.

 I can get this using this plugin:
 https://github.com/texxasrulez/additional_imap
 And did some ajusts:
 ​
  
Delete all custom config from gmail and gmx(or other if you use it) of /plugins/additional_imap/config.inc.php
 
Enabled "Show real names for special folders" in Settings->preferences->Special Folders
 
Add rc3k_ prefix to plugin tables on DB.
 
 ​
 To be a perfect solution, only miss one little thing:
 ​
 ALL INBOXES Option
 ​
 There is no multi-accs-webmail-imap-reader with a nice interface available for free/selfhosted, this roundcube+additional_imap its the closest solution that i can found.
 Im a happy user of SparkMail, but they dont have a web/win version.
 Nextcloud Mail app do the job, but is too slow and buggy...

 If you know a better solution, please send it here! Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 After many many years of ignoring reverse proxy, I sat down today to finally set one up. I have spent the morning looking over many videos and different ways of doing it, but it seems that most of them want you to have your sites remotely accessible. In my case, I want a simple method of accessing all my services without remembering what ports and addressing they would be on. I know that MDNS does a lot of it. But it's no good for nested services with ports. I've started to dive into the SWAG documentation. I'm not sure if ngix manager or swag would be a better fit. My google-fu has failed me, or maybe I'm being impatient to find the right tutorial. 
 I'm looking to pull off, something as easy as:
 homeassistant.local
 sab.local
 smokeping.localdomain. 
 octoprint
 unfi.localdomain
 omv.localdomain 
 portianer.local
 ​
 then I want to configure some sort of easy home page like homer that my wife and I can easily find. Can anyone point me to a video or blog that would be able to guide me through?

 Following up on a previous post. Thanks for the kind and constructive feedback! We have considered the most requested features and crafted a Public Roadmap. 
 Check it out here https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee/projects/2 and please let us know what you think.
 We are behind in features comparing to Tailscale or Zerotier, but I believe we are on the right path to cover most of them. Our main goal is a fully open-source system so that it can be r/selfhosted without any hidden parts.
 Shortly on main points from the roadmap:
 - Peer management with a UI dashboard so that you don't need to add peers manually
 - Automatic network changes provisioning so that every peer in the system has the latest state (and newly added peers)
 - Windows support
 - ACLs
 - Mobile clients
 We are a team of two and are looking for some help :). Feel free to reach out if you are willing to contribute.
 Cheers,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I have:
  
a server w/ 4c CPU and 32GB RAM
 2TB ZFS Pool (originally made by FreeNAS & Full of Data)
  
What I want:
  
preferably FOSS
 Web Interface
 Creation/editing/deletion of VMs
 Management for Docker (haven't dabbled in docker yet, but definitely want to)
 Ability to adopt existing ZFS-Pool
 Ability to mount directories on said ZFS pool to VM's directly (e.g. mount "/mnt/ZFS/music" on the host to "/music" on the VM without a network connecting host and VM)
 Ability to assign different VMs to different VLANs (on the host network)
 SMB File sharing
 maybe some load-balancing in the future (not required)
  
What I want this for:
  
local network file server (smb)
 reverse proxy (nginx)
 website host (nginx)
 mediaserver (don't know yet)
 VPN-Server (openvpn)
 Matrix Homeserver (don't know yet)
  
Does anyone know an OS that would check these boxes?
 I am asking because my FreeNAS boot stick died, and now that I have to redo it anyway, I'm wondering whether there is a better way to do this. (I am going to use a 128GB SSD for the next install to not repeat this error.)
 I have tried Proxmox as well, and it does a lot of these things right, but I cannot find a (GUI) way to do the mounting I described above, also doing all the ZFS and SMB configuration in the terminal only sounds like a recipe for a security disaster if I am the person configuring it, even though it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am a developer who has a vps for some basic stuff, but I guess this is not that important for this question. Scrolling through this sub I see some awesome things that would make life a lot easier, however I can't find a lot about the setup people use (config wise, not hardware). This sub has some awesome posts like what people use, what they've learned, how they failed, etc, but I'm more curious to how you've setup your server and what you like / dislike about the setup.
 For example, I'm planning to start self hosting and redo my vps setup in the following way:
 Ubuntu with docker, openssh, ufw and fail2ban, as I'm already familiar with this and it keeps it easy to what I've installed directly on Ubuntu itself. Then use Portainer with nginx reverse proxy to setup all the various services like NextCloud, wiki, etc. Probably setup 2 database instances (prod/dev) in case something breaks and so I can start fixing it without hurting production. Lastly, add something to back up the docker containers and config to an external party, just don't know which one yet. 
 What I like so far: - Little directly installed on Ubuntu itself so updates are easy and I can quickly see if the problem is with docker, the service or Ubuntu - Server wise it's a bit easier to make it secure with only a few things running on Ubuntu itself - Docker itself, just nice to have everything running in containers
 What I don't like / not sure of: - Pure my config, but current setup has 1 DB for all services - I've heard that securing and updating docker containers are an absolute nightmare (I'm pretty new to docker so not sure) - Everything is running on docker, so if docker fails all fails - For all new services I'll use I have to export and import the config in the dev database (or the other way around)
 So how did you guys set up your server and what do you like and dislike about it? Maybe share your experiences so far with different setups so new (rookie) members can learn :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run my homelab on a Proxmox machine. I have several LXC containers and a couple virtual machines, each running a single service. So far, everything is attached to the same bridge vmbr0, which is attached to the physical network card. Since I am getting a new drive, I wanted to reinstall my homelab and restructure its network, putting each service (or group of services) in its own network, so that they are properly isolated from each other and communication between them can be regulated by the firewall.
 The standard approach seems to be to make a series of bridges vmbrX, one for each network, and to create a virtual machine running pfSense or OPNSense managing such bridges, handling all the routing between them and vmbr0. I was wondering, however, if there is a way to do this without the additional virtual machine. Could Proxmox itself handle the routing in place of OPNSense? There are firewall settings, and there are multiple network settings (vlan, bridges, bonds), but I am not too familiar with the topic.
 Is there any good example of this setup, or do you have any advice?
 Notes:
  
 I do not want to use NAT. Ideally, I want my local network to be something like 172.16.0.0 and each service to be on something like 172.16.X.0, where the entire subnet can be reached from my local network (barring firewall, of course).

 ​
 I want to self host a watch together service so my friends and I can watch stuff off my home server. It would need to support basically mkv and mp4 video files, and I'd be okay with being the only one who has control over playback. 
 Basically, I just need to have a video stream to a webpage so my friends and I can watch it together. I have my own domain, so I just need the service.
 ​
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: I am running emby, so by the looks of things I may need to run a second media server side by side, or switch entirely. Any other suggestions are much appreciated though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon Everyone!
 I for some odd reason have been working on trying to get my HP Proliant DL180 G6 up with Windows Server 2019 with a mutual Raid 50 Drives. Its a 12 bay slot but I'm only using 7 currently. I have succesfully update and installed Windows Server 2019. I am having 2 issues. I have successfully installed Raid 50 and the install drive is a 500gb Drive seperate from the Raid 50.
 The first issue is setting up the Raid 50 for the VM and sharing it as an internal Drive. I dont care if its not C:\ but i need it to have a drive letter. I got the Raid 50 to show up once as Drive D:\ but it went away after a couple of minutes. Now it wont allow me to connect the Windows Server 2019 to Windows 10 VM through the ISCSI Initator. Ive tried to initialize the ISCSI device that was created in Server Management ----> Files and Storage Server -------> ISCSI
 But it always says cannot connected PC on both Windows Server 2019 and the Windows 10 Hyper-V VM.
 ​
 Ive also tried a share drive and an ISCSI and a server pool both fixed and dynamic. Ive tried rebootingt he VM and the HP Proliant DL180 G6
 I've copied the IQN, IP Adress from the Host Server 2019 Computer to Windows 10 VM and vice versa in ISCSI Initiator and i always get cannot connect to PC on both. Ive also tried to find a target and it wont allow me to add it. I have no idea what to do now. The storage pool is empty and i would prefer a fixed volume for faster transfer rates. I cant find the answer anywhere. Thank you ahead of time for all comments.
 ​
 ​
 2ND Issue:
 I Have a Nvidia Server graphics card. It doesn need a 6pin i have already installed the 16x rise. But Windows cant recognize the card can anyone help!

 Backstory:
 I used to use a Hetzner CX11 VPS for my Selfhosted apps. However, I wanted more storage and control. So, I brought myself a Raspberry Pi 4gb planning to use Cloudflare Tunnel to access my Raspberry Pi without opening ports on the house Router. However, I encountered problems with Cloudflare Tunnel, see below. 
 The main services that I host are:
 · Nextcloud
 · PiGallery2
 · Vaultwarden / BitwardenRs
 · Heimdall Dashboard
 I do have admin access to the house Router however I am going off to University in September and plan on taking my Raspberry Pi with me where I will not be able to open ports on the router.

 As my Synology just passed away, I am in need of a file sync utility that I can install on my wife and son's windows installs to sync a directory back to the fileserver on the LAN.
 Because of this reason....
  
it needs to be free and open source
 
It needs to silently sync without user intervention
 
It needs to sync when files are added not at a predetermined schedule
 
 I used to use Synology Drive and it worked well.
 What do you gents use?
 I've heard some bad things about duplicati so would probably want to stay clear of it.
 Also, I'd like to not have to install a utility on my server for the sync to be possible, e.g. syncthing
 (I'm using rclone on an Ubuntu container to keep Google drive in sync with a few local directories, very happy)

 What I want to do is also store a backup from the VPS to my home server, preferably via borg. I would prefer my home server to make the connection to my VPS, via ssh, and then do the backup of what I need.
 Anyone have a suggestion on best way to do this?
 Could I do a borg backup on my VPS, then rsync the borg save location to my home server?
 I am sure there is a better way to do it, just not seeing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run an unraid server with multiple docker containers. Rather than individual credentials for each app, I've started learning about Authelia and have successfully set up a simple authentication process for a container. Now that I have this first step working, I'm a little confused on next steps to deploy it into action:
 For example, say I have a container with paperless. I can protect the web UI for that container with authelia without much trouble, but how do I make paperless aware that I am logged in? Do I disable the paperless login mechanism to it auto logs in a user? (this seems dangerous). Do I use the token option to log in via API?
 Maybe it is different for each container, but a general workflow of how it's supposed to work or where I can read some tutorial would be appreciated.

 so, I really wanted to and now even more so want to create a home server that I could use to host anything I like/test and etc. I got to a technology school so me and a friend did a project with an old cisco server that we put ESXi on, a switch and other stuff and that made me understand how it all works and pushed me to want to set it up for real this time, I got a switch, ap and all the things needed but the actual server. one person at my school told me how he uses an old laptop with ESXi as a server. so I was wondering what would be a good starting point since I searched a bit and found decommissioned servers for about £100 I think and I don't know if that is work or if to just do what that guy did and create a server from a laptop 
 thank you in advance

 I've been working on my own apps for my home media needs throughout covid. I just released the Server and Music apps and posted about it on /r/musichoarders. Even though this subreddit isn't music related, I think the project might be interesting to some of you.
 It's called Cardinal, and it's an ecosystem of apps for playing your media at home. Right now the Server and Music apps are available for macOS and Windows as early access releases, and soon the mobile Music app will be released. Planned apps are Photos, Books, and TV & Movies, which will all feed from the Server app.
 There's also a GitHub for technical info, where lots of the code has been open sourced.
 The apps are free to use and free of all types of advertising, tracking, and marketing. It would be nice to get feedback on whether people are interested in using something like this, because I would love to work on this long term if there's enough interest. Any and all feedback is welcome!

 I am building a cocktail bar in my dining room and I am looking to take it a step further buy giving my guests (friends and neighbors) a tablet with a menu of cocktails. Below are a few things I am looking to accomplish. 
  
Keep an inventory of all alcohol / liquor on hand
 Associate cocktails with ingredients and as each ingredient gets used alert me that we are running low based on inventory. 
 Allow guests to start a tab, and email them a receipt of cocktails ordered...this would help them remember what they liked last time they ordered. 
 Front end menu would be a menu with either hand selected cocktails (limit) or all cocktails (based on inventory of ingredients)
  
I am 99% confident that this doesn't exist in a self hosted product, but I am ok with hacking something together. Maybe a combination of something like SnipeIT + ? ... I dunno. Any suggestions are welcome!

 I wanted to ask if anyone knew of a dashboard that has Google SSO.
 I don't need there to be any graphs or anything. Just a simple page with links and icons to all of the resources that we use.
 I've seen Homer but I don't think its meant to be used in an organisation and doesn't have Google SSO.
 If anyone knows of anything, Please do let me know!

 ​
 Setup
 Server A) Proxmox Home server running multiple VMs (jellyfin - its own drive, nextcloud - its own zpool, wordpress and few other dockers in LVM on proxmox)
 Server B) dedicated Ubuntu mining machine that can double as backup server
 ----------------
 Questions
 Q1) I am not sure the right way to back server A. Do I back everything ideally like LVMs + Zpool data all together as one single thing? How does back up works?
 Q2) Technically, PBS could be handy to run on B, but Server B will be running chia/mining stuff on Ubuntu 24x7. I can add few more disks to it and automate backup on it from server A. How to do it?
 Q3) Its not a huge deal for me if I lose proxmox configuration, but definitely want Zpool and Jellyfin and VM (website coding etc) data auto backed up on server B. But then just why not back config anyway if its simple so if I ever drop a hammer on server A by accident, I can get replacement up really quick.
 Q4) What is better raid on Server A since I will have Server B backing up. Do I need to waste a disc on A for redundancy. Server B is already in a different location and will have Server C as cold backup later.

 ​
  
Can Drone CI somehow put my html code into a web service image and eventually deploy it to my website?
 Or can I have Drone CI put the code in a certain location on my NAS, so that a docker image that runs, picks it up and shows it on my website?
 or can Drone CI somehow execute a docker-compose.yml file?
  
​
 what is the easiest/fastest thing i can do to get this done?

 so what Iam trying to achieve:
 html code -> gitea -> trigger -> Drone CI -> puts my code online (somehow)

 It's not yet ready to use (some core features are missing), but the idea is:
 Provide a (restricted) LDAP interface for services to list users and authenticate them, and a friendly web interface to manage the users. It's pretty opinionated (all users in the same OU, all groups in the same OU, limited query-only capabilities and so on) but should be sufficient for 90% of LDAP use cases, and has a *much* simpler deployment and management story than any full LDAP-based system.
 It's written in Rust to have minimal memory requirements, and the data is stored in SQL for simple backups. It would be absolutely trivial to wrap in a Docker container.
 If you are interested in contributing, check out https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap! Beginners welcome, I have some simple tasks to give if you're just starting with Rust.

 Can someone throw me a bone and a link / info on this.
 Dashboard, you click a button and it runs a command on the server. I'm thinking of using it to kick off docker images that run and do automated tasks such as create PDF reports based on numbers for work related stuffs.

 I am part of a group organizing a project. Most of the people are non-nerds and we need a tool to share information online. Normally Google Docs/Drive would be fine, but for idealistic reasons that is not desired. So I'm looking for a nice alternative that will allow us to 
 a) share files (PDF, images and so on) online 
 and
 b) be able to edit files via browser and especially
 smartphone, since most people are mobile users. It is enough to be able to edit text files. 
 There is no need for collaborative editing and text files are enough - no odt, no doc, plain text is fine.
 But it needs to be simple and it would be nice if it doesn't require a lot of additional apps on the phone.
 I skimmed the awesome selfhosted list, so far my best option would be Nextcloud and OnlyOffice pointing to the Nextcloud instance.
 Any better ideas out there? 
 Really perfect would be something like Mattermost, but with text editing (like an included Etherpad/Cryptpad feature). There is a Collabora plugin for Mattermost, but unfortunately it doesn't work on mobile/via the Mattermost app.

 I created an account on Hetzner and want to self-host these apps (I included what I use right now in brackets):
  
Ghost or Wordpress (using static site with 11ty - free)
 Linkding (using raindrop - free)
 Wallabag (using pocket - $2.73/year)
 MiniFlux (using miniflux hosting - $15/year)
 Nextcloud (using Google One - $6.88/year)
 Standard Notes (using InkDrop - free with dev license)
 Plausible (using goatcounter - free)
  
Because 1 Euro is equal to 10.26 Turkish Lira, I want to self-host these in smallest €2.49 CX11 server with these specs:
  
1 Intel vCPU
 2 GB Ram
 20 GB Disk Space
 20 TB Traffic
  
I won't use these apps regularly, I'll use them rarely. It will be mostly for learning purpose. I might even move to my current stack.
 So is this server specs enough for this purpose, if not what will be?

 ​
 I've learned a lot about self hosting in the last weeks, after a colleague told me about nextcloud.
 I bought a fully upgraded mac mini 2012, installed Virtualbox, created an ubuntuVM and set up docker + compose. I installed nextcloud and started experimenting with it.
 I got rid of my fiber internet access a few years ago because my mobile phone provider offers an additional data sim card for about $5/mo and my traffic is unlimited.
 But that plan isn't great: I'm behind CG-NAT (Carrier-grade NAT) which means there's no way for me to reach my server when I'm not on the home wifi because my public IP address is shared between several other customers.
 So I called them to enquire about public ipv4 addresses op…]]></summary>

 My setup is as follows:
  
Desktop with 4 TB HDD space, running Manjaro
 
Laptop with 250 GB SSD space, running Manjaro

Headless mini PC in a cupboard, connected to a 6 TB external HDD, intended as always-on server, running Ubuntu
  
What I want to accomplish:
 I want to be able to synchronize folders within my home folder between my laptop and desktop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just discovered this place and would like to introduce you to our open source routing engine:
 https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper#readme
 GraphHopper offers you the path finding functionality ("A to B routing") that you probably know from Google Maps and uses data from the incredible OpenStreetMap project (see also /r/openstreetmap).
 To fully self-host a route planner (e.g. a "Google Maps" equivalent) you need GraphHopper for the routing and two other parts: you also need some visualization aka "maps" (e.g. with OpenMapTiles) and you need the address search (e.g. with Photon).
 We have a hosted version of this and you can try it: GraphHopper Maps. It is also privacy friendly without any trackers.
 This web app is not (yet) as polished as Google Maps app but there are many projects that use the routing functionality of GraphHopper and offer "complete" apps like outdoor apps (komoot, trailrouter, ride with GPS, Locus Map, plotaroute, Kurviger) or other services (delivery hero, deutsche bahn, GLS, ...)
 And GraphHopper can be used for more things beyond routing like for reachability analysis:
 Reachability analysis across an entire country
 Make sure you follow our twitter or blog posts. For example we recently released version 3.0.

It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element.

Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

 I am looking for a self hosted project management software to use for a non-profit hospital. It should support Kanban boards and maybe even some Scrum, Burndown- & Gantt Charts.
 What I tried:
 - JIRA Software: Got a free community license but the terminology is too software focused
 - JIRA Core: Neutral terminology but no Kanban boards
 - Taiga.io: Looks awesome and our first test server was set up quickly but horrible to set up for configuration with HTTPS and so on. We can't get the mail settings or the LDAP sync to work and the documentation is clearly from coders for coders (a lot of knowledge is assumed).

 The canonical solution that seems to be supported by pretty much everyone is to have an LDAP server (OpenLDAP) and plugin everything to that server (Nextcloud users, Authelia for SSO/resource gating, Keycloak if you're feeling fancy and so on).
 That still leaves some services (e.g. Plex) with their own proprietary accounts (can't really work around that).
 Unfortunately, setting up and managing OpenLDAP is a pain, and it does way more than necessary.
 What are your solutions to that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got myself a Synology NAS and got into selfhosting. So im relatively new to all of this and making use of guides to get it working.
 One of the things I wanted to selfhost was a RSS feed which I found in FreshRSS. So I searched online for a guide on how to install this on my NAS and found this guide: https://mariushosting.com/how-to-install-freshrss-on-your-synology-nas/
 This guide explains really well how to install FreshRSS into docker but it ends there.
 So far so good followed the guide and got everything to work, installed the FeedMe app on my android phone and got my own RSS feed. Only to find out that it does not automatically refresh my feed. I have to push the actualize button myself everytime which is obviously not what I want to do. Ideally I want it to automatically refresh every X minutes.
 So the beginner I am tried searching for solutions, which I found but got none to work. On the FreshRSS website it self it states I have to do something with the ./app/actualize_script.php but the fun thing is with the guide I used mentioned above I got none of those things. Don't have the app folder nor have I the script they are talking about. The only folders I have are crontabs, keys, log, nginx, php and www. And inside those folders there is also nothing to find they are talking about.
 So for a summary I have FreshRSS running atm in a docker container on my Synology NAS which is working but only need a solution for how to automatically refresh my feed every X minutes or so.
 Does some of you have experience with this and can help a starting self hoster out?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: Not Refresh but FreshRSS thanks!

However, I can't seem to upload videos (tried different formats/codecs) and I don't know how to pin websites. It seems to only do images or gifs. Am I doing something wrong? Are these features not implemented yet?
 If those are Pinry limitations, what do you fellow self-hosters use that handles at least videos? TBH, I don't really care about websites, but it would be a nice addition.

 Not necessary but are welcome -Billing Management -integrated mail and calendar viewer
 The software should be selfhostable and preferably open source.

 From that publicly accessible VPS, I want to be able to RDP into a home computer behind a NAT. 
 The solution normally would be to use some sort of VPN (OpenVPN, WireGuard, ZeroTier, etc) to connect the VPS host to the home network. 
 How is it done from inside a docker container to a home network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there. I am relatively new to the home server scene, but I've quickly begun hosting several services on mine. A personal website via nginx, Pi Hole, Home Assistant, Vaultwarden, etc. - all of these have helpful web interfaces that want to display on ports 80/443 by default. I've been skittish on setting some of these up, for fear of disrupting what I already have working, and I'm curious about what people recommend as the best solution. There are some solutions I've been investigating - having each service use its own arbitrary port, or I think it's possible to manage everything via nginx (I see the word 'reverse proxy' thrown around, but I have no idea if the nginx settings I've been fiddling with is that). I would like to see what people here suggest. Thanks.

 I never got to the point of noting all these details down with pen and paper, as some friends of mine were doing for years, however, I was keen to find a web or app-based solution that came also with all the bells and whistles in terms of data visualization, maps, and the like.
 I found out about FlightMemory, but, as you will understand, I was not exactly thrilled by its looks. A good one I have been using is myFlightradar24, particularly when it comes to its map view, however, I was looking to see if there was a self-hosted one or even a excel template to get the options to play with your flight data and perhaps customise the periods of time you wish to look at and create infographics.

 Say, 10+ TB non-SMR drives for a NAS. What would you say is your steal price

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using a 3rd party service to schedule my (MySQL) database backups, it runs a mysqldump at a specified interval and stores the copy on a remote storage service (eg. Backblaze B2).
 I am looking to replace this service with a self-hosted solution/script, it should do the following:
  
Be able to run a db export command (eg. mysqldump) at a specified time interval, probably using a cron job
 Upload the local backup to a remote storage (AWS, B2, etc.)
 Send alerts/notifications if a backup fails
  
My initial idea was to create a script that does all the above things, and simply run that script as a cron job on the server of the database itself. I know this is not ideal, as if that server goes down the fail notifications won't work anymore. To solve this, maybe just use a separate server to log the backup successes, and that server could handle notifications if a success wasn't received in a specified amount of time.
 ​
 Do you know of any self-hosted apps/scripts that do this? If not, I will try writing one myself as the implementation should be pretty easy.

 As the title says, I currently have a Node 804 case currently hosting a Ryzen 3600, ASRock AM4/X570M, 4 8TB SATA hard drives and a 1660 super for all of my transcoding needs.
 I'd like to replace this case with something that can be rack mounted, I don't know a whole lot about server cases so I thought I'd ask those more knowledgeable.
 Ideally I'd like to have quite a few more drives in the case whilst still having support and enough room for the GPU. Is a SAS/SATA backplane possible? Can anyone think of a case that might work?
 Thanks!

 just evaluating a start page.
 Here https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#personal-dashboards I've seen there is a collection of tools for doing this, can you tell me your experiences with them and which satisfy better my requirements without have to test all of them :)?
 I'm interested in the following aspects:
  
easy to install: docker, pulling a single image of course is better of a docker compose file
 easy to config: I prefer no config file but a user interface with Add botton for services and group of services
 lightweight
 stable, well maintained
 responsive
 user interface: icon + text for each service; the page should be "dense" of contents, to see at glance a lot of services ( I mean, no too wasted spaces)
  
Actually I'm using Heimdall but I have not understood why "link tiles" are not alphabetically ordered, they are chronologically ordered. I read about Homer but it seems it does not satisfy requirement 2; also seen Organizr but is too complex.
 ​
 Thx as usual!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog post from James Reynolds, delves into using Fedora CoreOS, Portainer, and WordPress in 7 easy steps. The magic of Fedora CoreOS is that it configures itself at install time, including installing Portainer and enabling the host firewall. Once configured, you can quickly and repeatedly set up this server without logging into it. Then you can use Portainer to run any container or docker-compose file like WordPress. By firewalling Portainer you protect your admin interface from possible attacks while leaving the services rendered by your other containers accessible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not usually the tinfoil hat type but targeted ads are really starting to rub me the wrong way. This post (instagram link FYI) in particular rang alarm bells in my head this morning.
 Ive been meaning to trial hosting a PiHole instance on my Unraid server at home for the last few months and I think I just got the push I needed to take the plunge and give it a shot. From what I understand (I've done 0 reading of documentation so far) you host it, set up your preferences and then point all your devices to it as a DNS. I assume I could just set that on my Router and it would auto push that setting to all my devices inside my LAN through DHCP at the point of next timeout, or just clear the table and let it do its thing.
 My question is that assuming all the above is correct, if not a little oversimplified, I could probably also tunnel all my devices that are outside of my LAN through Wireguard and route them through my home internet connection as well, thereby benefiting from PiHole while outside of my LAN, right? Has anyone else attempted a similar thing? My home internet connection isn't blazing fast but it doesn't have a data cap. If this is something thats doable I would seriously consider upgrading my connection if it required it.
 Side note: I also realize that PiHole isn't some magic bullet that stops all this tracking garbage in its tracks but it can significantly reduce how many ads make it to my screens which is a step forwards for me.

I struggled with all of them at some point in time but managed to google-fu my way through to get what i need. Now more and more its becoming easier to set things up and get them running. If it helps - I also work in software. I'm not a developer, but I do have a basic understanding of how things are supposed to work.
 Having said all that, after some googling - it sounded like paperless-ng is exactly what i needed next for my solutions i'm doing. One of the biggest factors is that it was super simple to stand up and get running. However, reading …]]></summary>

 Any idea where I could find something like that, preferably that I can install using docker ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. 
 I currently have an 8GB Raspberry Pi running OpenMediaVault and an 8TB external hard drive set up with most of my data on it (mostly just random files). I initially started this as a hobby, but I've found myself getting more into it, and using OMV on a practical level. I have some docker containers set up (nextcloud, nginx, home assistant, adguard, and a few others). I run regular backups of my phone and PC, and am looking into the possibility of backup up all of my photos there too (thanks Google).
 I want to add more storage and at least one other drive for backup/redundancy. Before I start spending money and building out, I wanted some thoughts opinions on how to go about this...
 I'm currently satisfied with the Raspberry Pi running OMV, is there any need to buy a full NAS? What are your thoughts about just buying a 4-bay external hard drive enclosure and adding drives? The 8TB I currently have is an external drive from Costco. Can I just get away with buying another one of those? If I get a multi-bay external enclosure, could upgrade to a more powerful server in the future?
 I'm stuck at the moment, as I don't know which way is the best to go. I'm looking for best bang for the buck while keep some flexibility to upgrade (storage and performance) in the future. 
 Sorry for my scattered thoughts. Any help, feedback, suggestions, etc would be extremely helpful. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm completely new to this and was following along an online book "Obey the Testing Goat" setting up a server using Nginx, Gunicorn, and Django to host on the Pi. I got it working well using my domain name I purchased from GoDaddy for a buck, but I wanted to try and make it so it's accessible more than locally.
 I learned a tiny bit about Dynamic DNS and heard DDclient + CloudFare is a good option to go with. If I understand this right, which I probably don't, then I need to add a CNAME record on GoDaddy which routes to CloudFare. From CloudFare, I need a couple A records which point to my Pi's public IP, which is not static, so DDclient updates it continually.
 How do I set this up? How do I know what CNAME record I need to add to GoDaddy, or am I doing it wrong altogether?
 Currently, going to my domain gives me an error -
  
"Error 1002: DNS points to local or disallowed IP" 
  
Which according to Google, a DNS record points to CloudFares servers and I need to update my A-records. Not entirely sure what to make of this. I'm fairly certain I need to update my CName on GoDaddy but I really don't know what to update it to.
 On a sidenote, I'm not entirely sure my DDclient is working properly either and need to update the conf file, but unfortunately I do not have access to it at the moment or the logs it gives me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a media server that I host now on an RPi4. The exposed stuff is jellyfin and seafile. 
 This works really well for just home use, but I would like to build a better server to accomodate for more ppl. Specifically my question is, and this is assuming my bandwidth is high enough to do all of this: 
  
Is there a good way to figure out what specs I need for lets say 4-5 concurrent streams (maybe x265, so hw decoding?) 
 If I would build a PC to do this, I would still aim for low idle power usage (4-5 streams is probably peak), and for 80% the server will be quite unused.
 How do I do this raid thing in a normal PC and how do I assert other than having an offsite backup that I have data redundancy for my seafile clients
  
Any resource is helpful thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably a weird one, but I'm going to hold a contest for my YouTube channel, and am looking for a Self Hosted system to have the users register on. Trying to make this as easy as possible, vs having to manually move comments or tweets or whatever other method over, then get it all into some randomizer. I will absolutely do that if there's nothing else, but looking for any self hosted, open source options, or ideas you all may have of a good way to automate this. 
 It's my first go round with a give away, but I'm excited about doing it. At the same time I'm nervous about it, and want it to be as fair as possible.
 I'm looking to simply get an email address, and whether the person needs the 120 V or 240 V kit I'm giving away. Once winners have been chosen, I'll contact them via the email to get shipping info, etc.
 I figured I could do it on my RocketChat system with a special channel, but wasn't sure how to get the user info into a useable tool to randomly select the person. Maybe there's a plugin for it that I haven't found yet. 
 Any ideas or suggestions are much appreciated!

This includes PDFs, Word Documents, Excel Documents and other office type documents. I have them sort of organized by folders, but sometimes a document could potentially live in one of several folders and of course I usually forget where I put them. I want some sort of software that can search this. Ideally, I'd want to be able to tag files and possibly have the text searchable. I have looked at a few of the document management apps, but those seem to want to pull the documents into their own storage. I'd rather just point the software at the existing directory and have it process the metadata.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I feel like I am very close to getting things running, but I have a couple of issues. When I go to my domains section of mailcow admin and click DNS, this is the information in the modal:
 https://i.imgur.com/1UJLY5l.png
 So issue #1 is that I think the server is expecting/listening for the the wrong public IP. I have tried to look everywhere to change this setting, but I failed 😞. Does this mismatch matter? If so where do I change/hardcode this?
 Issue #2 is smaller, but I can't figure out how to make the TSLA certificate be "Connection refused" instead of the actual hash of the certificate... 
 Also ports 80 and 443 for my mail.domain.tld go to a reverse proxy server and then to mailcow, whereas the mail ports go to mailcow directly from the router. My inbound and outbound port 25 is blocked by ISP. With the port checking tool, I am able to verify that all other mail ports on my public IP are listening. 
 The TSLA issue I guess is an optional setting, but I think the mismatch in the IPs are not allowing the mail server to listen properly, resulting in bounces: 
 https://i.imgur.com/EYx5Usc.png
 Not sure if the PTR record matters all too much either, if it does I can see about getting it modified. For the record, I'll probably be sending out through a relay, but I need to be able to receive on my own. If not, are there good options that can forward all mail to me?
 I also have a VPS which I guess I can tunnel to and set up all my DNS records to go there. If I forward all the mail ports from the VPS to mailcow, would that work? Man, I'm not looking forward to getting the iptables setup for dockerized mailcow to use a wireguard interface for wan. But I guess I saw the iptables config in some file so I could potentially just modify that. I don't know, I rather go through my public IP route... 
 If someone can help me out, I'd greatly appreciate it! Thanks!

 I recently started running Gitea in Docker and would like to use it to manage and modify my Wordpress files and Docker-compose yml files. I have around 40 docker images running on my QNAP (NAS).
 is this possible?
 Furthermore, it would be absolutely great if, Jenkins recognizes those changes and releases the docker image with it. to save time
 is this (functionality) possible? Unfortunately I can't find much documentation about it.
 ​
 my situation:
 At the moment I edit my docker-compose files manuelly via Notepad++ and with 'docker-compose up' I bring them up in the air. but then I have no version control and I have to manually deploy the relevant image every time.

 just wanna summerize here my experiences related with the object of the topic. This is a sort of organized recap of my previous thread, read it for more info and details. Really thanks to all of those users that wrote there, helping me a lot and doing the big part of the job.
 So, the question is: you some selfhosted services on your own lan and they or you need to use https protocol, or similar ones, and therefore you have to use some sort of certificates, avoiding the self signed ones because browser do not like them. You also want to reduce the effort in the management of this problem, automating all that is possible.
 SOLUTION 1:
 You can install and configure your own PKI+CA, release certificates etc... but this approach causes you need to import your root CA certificat…]]></summary>

 I'm a Minecraft noob - like, literally, never played the game. I'm gifting it to my 6 year old for their birthday and am curious if I should set up a server for them from the start, or if that's something that can wait?
 They'll start off playing on Android tablets (Bedrock Edition), and possibly also on the Nintendo Switch.
 I'm running unraid and have plenty of headroom to add a docker for it... just wondering what the pros and cons are? What are the benefits? What are the downsides?
 Thanks!

 My current job requires repetitive typing with small variations (e.g. "car door: undamaged vs damaged").
 I am looking for some sort of (ideally web-based) self-hosted/open-source free text editor that can handle custom templating, that then exports to plain text.
 Does this exist, or am I going to have to make it myself (e.g. using React with one of the text editing libraries)?
 Thanks!

 Something pretty critical to me is smooth handling of email invites. I send and receive invites to folks who are using Exchange, Gmail, and whatever else on their phones.

 I am using Syncthing for all my files management across my devices and I am currently using my big-fat-old computer in order to store big files, using an old 1 terrabyte HDD in order to store medias I rarely use but want to keep (ig photos and some music).
 Is it a good idea to zip the files ? How do you access your datas and is there more elegant ways to navigate my photos over the file manager ? And finally, what are the alternatives to google photos for A.I. ? 
 If there is a good one that works locally it would be super nice :D

 Sorry if the questions are too much 'trivial'.

 Closest I could come to that does what I want is afterlogic, but its a paid service and I don't think its open source.
 Edit: afterlogic is open source, so that is good. And they do have a free lite version, but no calendar/carddav support in the lite version. The paid version would be okay, but updates are only supported on a per year basis, so after a year you need to buy it again for any updates.

So I'm coming to you guys to see if this is something you've seen before or would be interested in. It would be self-hosted, I would not provide any hosting whatsoever since I would have access to the access key and the secret key the AWS provides, so there'd be no trust that I would be able to provide on my side. However, if somebody has already done this, I would be interested in reviewing the code for it. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m thinking of building a new server for my increasing needs, below are the services I’m hoping to host on the new server. This server does not need to fit into a rack but will be on 24/7.
  
Nextcloud (Family use so under 5 users, but used for file backups and sync)
 PhotoPrism (Family use so under 5 users, but used for image backups and sync)
 Jellyfin (Family use so under 5 users, but almost never streaming at the same time)
 Custom apps (Apps that I make, almost no resource use, just things that need to be run on an always on server)
 Plus a little room to expand in case I want to host something new
  
Here is a link to what I’m thinking of getting on PC part picker: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/CcY3p2
 Nextcloud says it needs ~ 8 GB of ram and ~ 6 cores for 25 users so I expect to be using ~ 4 GB ram and ~ 3 cores. PhotoPrism says it needs ~ 4 GB of ram and ~ 2 cores but also says “Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should match the number of cores. ” Jellyfin has people saying it works fine with ~2 GB of ram and I expect it to use less than 2 cores And my custom apps should use way less than 2 GB of ram and less than 2 cores
 I didn’t think I needed a graphics card as 1) they are incredibly high in price rn and 2) I didn’t think any of my hosted apps would take advantage of it. Do you see a problem with this?
 Also, I’m having a problem choosing my storage. I want fast storage but with my budget (Preferably less than $700) and my internet connection (Around 100 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up), I’m not sure that I would see a difference between an HDD vs M.2 SSD. Do you have any recommendations on this?
 As a side note, I have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse laying around that I can use for this build, and am planning on putting a Linux distro on it.
 Do you see any problems with my build? Thanks for all of the help in advance!

 I'm currently writing a backup script. I have several services which are run via docker-compose. My basic idea was to stop all of them -> backing up the compose files, config + volumes and then restart. But how can I do that? 
 The idea was to use labels for the containers to know which should be backed up. I can get them without a problem via bash. After that I just wanted to start them again. But how do I do that? A simple docker start "container" is not enough because this would not start other containers which are the base for some services. So I have to use docker-compose up -d to start them again. But for this I need to get the path to the docker-compose file. But I only have the id of the container.
 Any ideas?

 I’ve been bit with the privacy bug and decided to self host my business files. So I went ahead and acquired a NUC so that I can run Nextcloud and connect to it via VPN when I’m not at home. 
 The thing is I’m reasonably tech savvy but completely useless when it comes to command line and Linux. I intended for this to be a quick operation to setup so I can get back to work- but man was I wrong. I have no clue what’s going on to the point where following the wikis I get lost. (I.e. ignition file for CoreOS). 
 Can someone just point me in the right direction?

 NPM seems easier to manage and it looks like I can basically re-use my entries for each subdomain in the advanced settings that lets you apply your own settings instead of ticking checkboxes. Thoughts? Send it? Don't do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ive been workin on a Beowulf cluster computer made out of some raspberry pis. Currently it is running Kubernetes (K3s) and MPI, but I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with PVM as a clustering solution. In theory, it seems like it'd be easier to manage than mpiexec'ing every command, but I'm quite new to all this, so it may not be. Once I get K3s fully up n runnin it may prove things to be simpler than I'm expecting.
 So yeah, whataya think¿ I've done a wee bit of research on PVM and there's not a ton out there, am I just lookin in the wrong place¿ Is PVM horribly outdated (the website certainly was lmao)¿ Thanks¡

I am in need of an alternative to google photos that can run on a PC that I have running that I also use for Plex. My main purpose of this is mainly to share photos with family and friends. My girlfriend is an amateur photographer and needs something similar to google photos for sharing to clients. I am hopeful to find a program that can run in windows 10 similar to Plex as it would be easiest in my current setup. Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm running wireguard using the linuxserver/wireguard docker image.
 I managed to get the connection working between containers on two different host.
 Here's what's going on:
 Host A > container A > Network < container B < Host B
 I got the bold areas to connect (i.e. wg container on host A can ping wg container on host B, but cannot reach the host)
 `docker exec` into the container and ping the other host: ok
 ssh into host and ping the other host: not reachable
 What can we do with the docker container config or wg config to allows host A to ping host B?
 I would like to keep all changes made within the computer instead of on the host itself it at all possible. Perhaps some volume mounts or something?
 Only if there is really really no way to do this without modifying host files, will I consider doing so.
 Any help appreciated!

 I want to create multiple "sections" and allow users to upload content (PDF, images etc) in a section, via their browser.
 The user should not register or be required to create a new account. I should password protect each section and anybody who has the credentials should be able to upload in that section. 
 The end result would be me giving a link+credentials to a person/group. Everybody who has the link+credentials should be able to upload anything on my server, in that specific section, via that URL.
 S3 integration would be highly appreciated. 
 Any hints?
 Thank you!

How would I keep nginx_pm on its own network (and possibly move WireGuard to its own network) but have directives to proxy traffic to the WireGuard container?

 We use it when we need to onboard or offboard employees to make sure everyone in the team is doing their part of the job. 
 It’s a really nice tool, far from the scary workflow management tools I have seen elsewhere. 
 Do you have any idea about something similar which could be self hosted ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently leased a VPS to host a few services, and took the first steps towards locking down the server (Ubuntu Server 20.04).
 What I have done so far:
  
Update & Upgrade the system
 Install / enable unattended-upgrades & apt-listchanges (automatically install important updates daily, and monitor/list changes automatically)
 Create a non-root user, add to sudoers
 Lock down SSH 
 Change to a nonstandard port
 Create & configure key based SSH login (key protected with password)
 Disable root login via SSH
 Disable password login via SSH
 
 Configure Firewall 
 Create rule to allow but limit SSH in on new port
 Create rules to allow in, on other necessary ports (for me just 80 and 443)
 Set default deny for everything else.
 Rule to drop ping requests
 Enable firewall
 
 Setup fail2ban for SSH 
 Rather relaxed 15/15/15 rule (15 failed logins, in 15 minutes = 15 minute ban)
 
 Check to make sure apparmor is enabled and in enforcement mode
  
​
 On the to-do / research list are (1) setting up mail so important system mail is sent (or forwarded from 'root') to my actual e-mail address (2) figuring out backups of some sort
 ​
 What additional steps would you take?
 What have I left out / forgotten / got wrong?

 Has anyone done this? Can I take a peek at your config? I'm totally at loss here. I've been googling for days :D
 I'm suspecting I have to do some custom nginx config for Taiga, but none of the stuff I have tried so far has worked. I'm not all that sure how I should get those VIRTUAL_HOST and LETSENCRYPT_HOST environment variables across to nginx-proxy either.

I'm essentially following JDM_WAAAT's NAS killer 5.0 guide and just want to know how it still holds up, or if there are better options since it is a year old. Usage will be primarily Plex/Sonarr/Radarr/Jackett/qBittorrent with one local client and possibly ~2 remote streams. I plan on getting into unRaid/Docker and exploring additional projects. I've never built a computer before so any feedback/resources/advice would be appreciated.
 CPU: i7-5775C or i7-4790 (whichever I can get for <$150/$200)
 Motherboard: Asus z97-A
 Ram: 4x8gb whatever is compatible/cheap
 Cache: 1tb ssd
 Array: 7x6tb WD Reds
 Case: CoolerMaster n400
 Miscellaneous: power supply, fans, cpu cooler, SATA cables, SATA power cables, thermal paste
 This is the general idea, but is there anything I'm forgetting overlooking? Any concerns/bottleneck/connection issues I should be aware of? I want to spend under $2k all in.

Before Paperless-ng, I created a bash script to do the scanning and OCR for me (props to OCRmyPDF, it works great), but I didn't have any learning or tagging system. So far it seems to work well, but I wanted to hear about other document management systems and their various strengths and weaknesses. Does one work better at invoices or does another seem to hang up on certain languages?

 I am in the process of building a home server, and wanted to know if anyone knew any cool webscraping projects they've deployed.
 For some reason, the idea to reach out and ping different internet servers for information or to gather data, etc, sounds like a ton of fun. Its just an ocean of servers, and there's gotta be some cool stuff to find (FTP, directories, etc).
 Any projects involving Archive.org , Wayback Machine, etc would be super cool too.
 Or if you guys have any previous webscraper or webcrawler projects you'd like to share for reference, I'm all ears. I ask because I used to be super into this to make Twitter bots that did this, and wanted to get back into this but more so for my personal website, and for my home server too.

 I've gone the gambit of trying to debate how to go about this, but wanted your take on this to see if there is anything decent to do some bird watching.
 Are there any decent, easily deployable, bird watching projects to do secure streams of an outside bird feeder?
 This sounds really dumb, but the one great thing about working from home sometimes is that one of the bird feeders gets swarmed with some really cool looking birds (we're talking cardinals, blue jays, etc) and I would love it if I could deploy a decent webcam that could do motion capture for this kind of thing.
 I would deploy it on a site too if its secure as well, but wanted it to be a bit hacker proof in that I don't want anyone to be able to just control the camera. 
 I kind of was thinking to have something that would be able to just record previously recorded video which I could then dump onto a video file on my site later, so it would stream initially on LAN, and then be dumped to a file on my site for public viewing later.
 Any ideas?
 ​
 I'm open to getting a Pi (Zero, 3, 4, etc) with related power banks. Its just the idea of how to power it over a whole week is what has kept me from actually doing it.
 ​
 Thanks as always!

 so currently i am looking for parts for a new homeserver build for my VMs.
 So my plan for 24/7 running VMs is:
  
2-3x Win 10 VMs with light workloads (1-2 core, 4-6gb Ram each)
 2x Linux VMs (Plex and Nextcloud) (1 core, 2-4gb Ram each)
 as well as some Linux VMs for testing Stuff (1 core, 1-2gb Ram each)
  
As Os i was planing to go with ProxMox, budget is around 800€ without any Storage or GPUs but adjustable. Further i had the idea to maybe convert the server to a cloud gaming host later on (2 gaming VMs with a GPU passed through each) bc of that the server should have plenty of PCiE Slots. Pls also consider the long therm costs (power usage), also i dont care if normal pc case or rack. 
 My first Idea was to build the server:

Specifically, porn clips and photos. I have a bucket of video clips from various tube sites that I’ve saved with almost no tagging and metadata, and with fairly generic titles that don’t include any details on the performer/actress/etc. 
 I also have a lot of properly named full videos from torrents, etc, that have performers/dates/company/etc. Those should be easy to organize in something like Stash, etc. 
 This may be harder for videos, I understand. But for photos, is there something like this, but self-hosted? Like will it recognize things like blonde, brunette, etc?
 I have a newer Synology along with a few Linux boxes (i5 4th Gen, etc) and I’m familiar enough with Docker. Does what I’m looking for exist?

 However I am very concerned with the security of my bucket. It isn't public, I am using an IAM policy to control access to the data on it. However I am aware that a few years ago there were several major data breaches at companies which relied on S3 Buckets. Reading up on this they seem to have been caused by user misconfiguration, but there was at least one instance where hackers were able to access the IAM credentials thru Server Side Request Forgery. 
 My set up isn't nearly as complex as it was for these large corporations - should I be concerned? Is an IAM policy enough or is there something else I can do to secure my data? I know that nextcloud already has a feature that lets you encrypt data , is that enough?
 Also, what storage provider do you guys prefer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have an Intel NUC. I'd like to use it to deploy a lot of self-hosted apps, both from open source as well as my own server application. For example, I'd like to set up a sourcegraph server so I can search over some of my repositories easily, and other kinds of servers and databases too (elasticsearch, kibana, redis, influxdb, prometheus, postgresql, maybe a docker registry or something) to get more experience and exposure.
 I'm struggling with some of the basics about starting, running, and deploying self-hosted apps. For example:
  
How do I keep my apps running all the time, even if 
 If my Intel NUC gets shut down (like, after a reboot), how do I get all the applications I was running back up again, ideally with zero fuss?
 How do I make sure all the apps I want keep running?
 How do I deploy changes to the apps? Ideally I could do this from my macbook which I use for development, and again with as little fuss as possible. In the best case, I can push a change to my GitHub repo, have a jenkins server running on my NUC run CI/CD tests, then deploy to the NUC.
 Do y'all run Docker or Kubernetes or something to run lots of apps at once?
 Also, is there a chat room or something where I can ask questions in low-latency? Like a slack or discord room you would suggest? (I haven't used IRC yet, so I'd prefer to stick to Slack or Discord).
  
Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know, the point of self-hosting is to self-host. I just don't really wanna spin up a server with 1TB of storage. Anyway, looking for some storage providers which support Borg repositories. BorgBase and Hetzner look attractive. Rsync.net is cheap and Hetzner is who hosts my VPS, so, it would make sense to spin up a Storage Box in the same place as my VPS (free internal traffic). Problem with these storage providers is that I'd need it to be on my VPN (WireGuard). I know they give a public IPv4 address so I could forward that in my DNS, but, I'd prefer it if it were on my VPN and private. I can't decide between Rsync.net and Hetzner; what's your experience with either one?
 ​
 Further on from that, I'm sure there are some other providers which no one knows about, those ones are usually the best. Any alternative providers you know?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have previously deployed wireguard using the linuxserver/wireguard docker image, and it was easy to set up with the objective of reaching my home server while away.
 Now, I'm looking to set up a vpn to connect some servers in the cloud into a subnet, without actually using the main wg server as a gateway (to avoid pinging traffic back and forth) - what I'm looking to achieve is to have different server computers accessible via a VPN network only, without proxying the traffic (ie clients use their respective gateways). Is this possible with wg? How should I set this up?
 I'm unsure as to how to set this up using docker. Nor do I have much experience with the 'ip' or networking packages. How would one set this up using docker? What prerequisite knowledge is important for a successful implementation here?
 I have read the official docs but was not able to see how to achieve the gateway criteria, and also did not have full understanding of the underlying 'ip' commands. Happy to get pointed to the right resources to achieve this.

 There's a somewhat popular forum I'm on that is sorta at the point where it will fly apart(and managment has taken the "I can do what I want with my 100k user forum, even if that means changing what its based on and about, go build your own"stance) but a decent chunk of the users have dial up like internet speeds. As a result, we are looking for something very light.
 Why not use the same software that that forum is using? Because it hasn't recieved any updates since 2011 and its recommended OS Windows server 2003.
 I have the internet capabilities, along with a pile of hardware sitting around and the others have knowledge in running and self hosting sites, but we can't seem to find something light to run, or something that light.
 Please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask, but it seemed like it was worth a shot to ask here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A number of years ago I saw a note taking app on someone else's PC which looked like yellow post-its, but each had a name. It would basically function like a post-it shaped wiki with references between notes and aliases for notes.
 If you used another note's name in the text of your note it would automatically hyperlink to it wiki-style. You could also create a new note from text in your current note and that text would always hyperlink to that note. You could also have aliases so various versions of text would link to the same note. 
 At least this is what I remember about it, but for the life of me I can't find it again now. It was on a linux machine, but I think it might have had a poor windows port at the time. 
 Is there something similar, which would maybe allow the creation of stuff like mind maps, indexes, collate the notes into books, etc., but which can be hosted as a web app? I've looked at a number of apps in the awesome selfhosted list, but, at least from the descriptions, none seem to fit the bill. Tidlywiki seems to come close, but I'm not so sure from what I've tried of it so far.
 PS. Ideally it should allow for easy upload of images, preferably in-line pasting of screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am looking for a monitoring solution running on probably one of my raspberry pies. It would be great if it can send an email in case of a host down and maybe temp is getting to high. Services and not hosts only and maybe a dashboard would be nice. At work we have Icinga but not sure if that is a bit overkill for my 5 raspberries. 
 Any idea of a cool docker Container solution for me?

 Not sure if posting in the right thread but thought i would give it a shot. Been searching the web for hours on end trying to find a company that offers both a project management like https://asana.com/ but also has a video review system built in like frame.io. I'm not sure if such a program exists but if anyone does know of any, your help would be very much appreciated! Thanks

 NVR software to monitor/record cameras seems pretty basic but of all the options, none are easy or good, I'd say.
 Ignoring all the windows only crap for obvious reasons
 Zoneminder: Extremely difficult to set up, even in docker, and once you do get it set up it's ugly as sin and hard to put on a different port.
 Shinobi: The "best" option but the dev is apparently a huge dick, their documentation is laughable, the UI is bad and again, very difficult to dockerize.
 Kerberos.io: Sounded great, easy to use docker, nice UI, ONE CAMERA PER DOCKER INSTANCE. Seems to be intentional to drive people toward their enterprise (paid) option.
 Unifi-video: Before it was killed, it was a ubiquiti product (avoid, awful support now, unfortunately), and very difficult to host or dockerize reasonably, especially if you want to use SSL or GOD FORBID put it behind a reverse proxy.

 I've got an i5 NUC with 16GB RAM. Running ESXI currently, hosting a Windows Server instance that runs some custom software (twitter bots etc) and then 3x Ubuntu VMs (UniFi Controller, Home Assistant, Pi-Hole).
 Wondering if I'm making the most efficient use of my NUC? I mean, I figure I'm probably not but I'm not entirely sure what the best way forward is.
 I see I can run Docker on Windows... I'm assuming it'd host all my above services?

 I've picked sourcehut because I really like the UI, I actually have no idea how light it is but I'm looking into having something similar as I find other alternatives having a lot of clutter, and uneeded features for me since I'm planing to have a small self hosted repository for some of my project.
 Are there any unofficial package repo for sourcehut for Ubuntu or are there any alternatives with a simple interfacte?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I just discovered this sub Reddit and this is absolutely what I wanted. Let me explain, I'm a huge Google client. I started to use Google photo to store unlimited pictures so I thought if Google have all of my pictures and data about me let it be useful and use it everywhere. Since Google photo is not unlimited anymore I want to self host my own stuff like a pi hole, a Nas, a domotic assistant, a node express test server etc. 
 So my question for you is, where to start. I see that a lot of you are hosting many things. Are you using one or many raspberry pi, are you using more powerful . I want to be able to add a "module"(self hosted server) one by one without breaking everything, so I can make the transition smoother.
 Note that I don't want to get rid of Google but I don't want to depend on it 
 Sorry if someone already explained it on a post, thanks you for helping me.

 I'm building a solution for a client. They like the look of NextCloud but I'm concerned about stories I've heard about poor performance. They will primarily be using it to catalogue large amounts of photo and video files (10-20TB).
 Main features are photo & video galleries, project/group based permissions, text chat, simple task management, and calendaring. NextCloud seems like a great fit for this but interested if anyone has any other suggestions which I could investigate as possible options?
 Many thanks, Adam.

I have NPM running in a Docker container via OMV and have a dozen or so subdomains working for all the different Docker containers. They all point nicely to different services running on different ports on the server and I'm very happy with how smoothly it's been going creating new Let's Encrypt certs and whatever.
 What I'm trying to do now is use the domain that I own to create a subdomain that points to a Docker container NOT on that same server. To be specific, I have a Linode server that's running something I want to be able to access at a subdomain that I own. I setup NPM on that Linode Docker in hopes that I could tie my domain.com to that as well and assign subdomains on that server but it's not working and I assume it's because I am already using that domain in the NPM container running on my home server. 
 ​
 Currently:
 subdomain1.domain.com points to 192.168.1.100:1234
 subdomain2.domain.com points to 192.168.1.200:1235
 and so on, and so on.
 ​
 I would like to add:
 subdomain3.domain.com points to 75.65.55.45:1234

 I am in the early stages of setting up a business and am looking to shed some costs off our expenses and run our own VoIP server. We run everything else ourselves including web services, mail services, file storage services etc, however looking at moving to our own phone system.
 I am a server administrator by trade so have a good knowledge of this sort of stuff, however when it comes to VoIP, my knowledge is very limited.
 What is needed to set up a VoIP server? Is it worth it?
 I assume I will need to configure the server itself, and purchase a number - how is routing handled? What other things will I need to consider? It will be running on a dedicated server hosted by OVH
 Requirements would need to be free/open-sourced or low-cost and maintained. UK numbers, and have the ability to run via a smartphone and/or a desktop PC (softphone)
 If it comes down to it, I will just continue the subscription with Skype
 Any info would be amazing, thank you!
 EDIT: It would be mostly inbound for receiving support calls

 For the moment, I don't like the appearance very much, and I would like it to be a little more customizable (color, text size, ...).
 The application is develop in Golang and available in docker hub.
 The source code is available in Github : https://github.com/Labbs/domo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an excellent subreddit and im glad i found it. I have some questions, i have done some research, but i figured this would be easier.
 I found navidrome a few weeks ago after dealing with constant nightmares with plex and emby. Not only does navidrome work flawlessly, but it's simple. 
 The first question is what is considered the best music server to run in a container on docker? All i really need is artist, albums, genres, playlist, etc. all the basics. Navidrome doesnt have genre as of this moment but i am paired to it via play:sub on ios and it has genres. I am really going to be using navidrome on my phone when i am not home. When i am home i will be using kodi. 
 The next question is about photos and videos stored on my nas. I used to use plex for music and for my photos and videos. They destroyed both music and photos and videos. Alot of the time, the videos would not play. I basically want something how plex worked. That has an app i can open and view my pics and videos fast. Right now i am using jellyfin just for my pics and videos, but it's a bit slow. I want the container to only read pics and videos, with no write access. I saw people recommending photo view which i can not install on docker synology. I also saw photoprism, but figured i would post this to what is the best route to go.
 Any other self hosted container recommendations would be great as well ! 
 Thank you!

I noticed that Wasabi is 10x cheaper than Spaces, however I have seen some people say that it may not be ideal if I want to stream media remotely without downloading it. I plan on storing home movies and photos on this cloud instance, so I am not sure if Spaces would be more ideal or if there is some third affordable option that is even better?

 Is there an existing android app that dumps all sensor data somewhere? It would be great if I could be able to pull up a database for keystrokes, gps location, accelerometer, possibly audio but this might require a fair amount of processing and bandwidth.
 Not intended to be some type of clandestine data collection operation. Simply my own way to store phone history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! 
 I recently have been tasked with integrating SMS notifications into a wordpress website to give users updates on their orders and deliveries. 
 As this is a delivery service, texting needs to be relatively immediate to avoid the drivers needing to wait outside the recipient's home. 
 That being said, we are looking to have 2-way conversations using the phone number we've ALREADY established with the clients for the business. So after much research I have found this service: 
 https://bulkgate.com
 They have a great functionality called "Mobile Connect" that allows you to essentially start a server on your phone to handle the sending / receiving of messages and then relay that info back to their server / api. 
 Realistically this is EXACTLY what I need (especially with their WooSMS plugin) however, sometimes the messages can take nearly 10 minutes to arrive. It's random and has no rhyme or reason as to why it takes longer, so it's difficult to debug. 
 I was hoping to discover if a similar service exists or If I can self-host my own gateway like Bulkgate has done to use my cell phone to send messages. 
 I have seen this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gsmmodem but have not gotten it to work and truly this would need a significant amount of development from this point. 
 Anyone have any ideas?

 so if any of you had any similar configs or can point me in the right direction to find my answer I would be very grateful. 
 I configured everything from a docker run command, and then found out you can enable the admin page, and tried from there, but both methods were not successful in sending a test email.

 this is the config, I tried the tls port and forcing tls, nothing helped.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for the past while I've been attempting to secure my files the best I can on my server. I know that files and data on enterprise cloud servers are encrypted (or at least I hope they are) and so I've tried to implement this just using GPG. I'm currently hosting my own Nextcloud instance but before that I was using one of the public servers that offer a certain amount of storage for free. I made a habit of removing metadata, compressing and encrypting the files so that I know that only I can access them but this became quite time consuming.
 I decided to setup some shell scripts to automate this for myself and I figured other people who are self-hosting or using a public Nextcloud server might be interested too. I wrote a basic guide on the steps I would go through and how this script can automate it to save time if anyone's interested.
 The Mat2 CLI alone is a great addition as it strips all the metadata from you files and it works recursively so it's fairly simple to use.

This way I could still use their excellent app. OFC I also consider paying for the higher tier, but a self-hosted way seem to be preferable for me. 
 I've seen LibrePhotos mentioned here (https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/npoxm4/librephotos_a_fork_of_ownphotos_with_video_support/) and think that this + GooglePhotos backup script (e.g. https://github.com/JakeWharton/docker-gphotos-sync) could do the trick. 
 I wonder if anyone already has such a setup running or consider to do it?

 I have 5 servers inside a 10.0.0.0/16 private network. And I have Docker Swarm initialized with --advertise-addr 10.0.0.4.
 My main goal here is to configure Traefik v2 within that private network. So, in traefikv2.yml I have this:
 networks: public: driver: overlay attachable: true ipam: config: - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24 
 It's ok to put my private subnet there? Which configuration do I need so Traefik works with that network inside my Swarm, and also listen to any user traffic comming from outside (let's say a website)?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need a way to backup all my Docker containers/volumes (really only the volumes, but the containers as well incase of compatibility issues) to the cloud. They're hosted across three different devices (2x RPi and 1x VPS). Now I'm thinking about it, would probably be useful if I could backup the commands used to start all my various docker containers.
 Duplicati stuck out to me because it looks easy but I've read that restoring a backup is a pain. What's your experience? If it's not been the best, what have you used/do you use instead?
 For some insight, my docker containers have volumes attached to them (/var/lib/docker/volumes/{code-server_data, portainer_data, etc}). All I could do is backup the volumes directory and that can be done with rsync, etc. But, I'd like it to be in a nice GUI which is another reason Duplicati stuck out to me, and the fact that it integrates with Cloud, which is probably where I'd backup to.
 ​
 I could care less about the OS itself - all I'd need to do is reinstall the OS and restore the docker volume backup and off I go.

 I'm new to the surveillance env, but I know about the privacy issues related to most of the commercial IP cameras and their softwares.
 I'd like to build a small surveillance system for my house, just a couple of cameras that I can control remotely from an Android phone (and locally from my Linux PC to easily configure and keep an eye on my cameras when I'm home).
 I normally use Docker on my PC and have got a small remote Linux server that I use for small personal projects. Unfortunately I don't have a Raspberry Pi, but I might consider to buy one. 
 What are my options, mainly privacy aware and what cameras should I buy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I wanted to spend a few months doing some personal testing to make sure everything was running stable. I'm happy to say my household has been using TaskBud for a few months now and it seems to be mostly bug free!
 Link to my project: https://github.com/SteffenBlake/TaskBud/
 What is TaskBud?
 Simply speaking its just a To-Do list app, but meant for multiple users, free to use, open source, and self hosted with support for features like:
  
CRON based repeating tasks
 "Wait Until" functionality
 Mobile First design
 Real Time App with SignalR, so when someone changes something you see the change asap on your screen as well.
 Markdown support
 And now with v1.1.0, basic API hooks for creating tasks! Which means you can use IFTTT or etc to bind your home assistant commands to push Tasks to the To-Do list pretty easily
 And a fair bit more!
  
I might add more API endpoints in the future if there is a demand for it, its not a lot of work but I just wanted to get what is needed for folks to be able to use their home assistants with Taskbud.
 Feel free to try it out!
 Found a bug?
 Report it here! https://github.com/SteffenBlake/TaskBud/issues

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone!
 I'm currently using a frankensteined Office PC for my server with an Intel i3-8100, 1 stick of 8GB DDR4-2666, and it's mounted to an Xpeneology running Dell Optiplex 320.
 I'm looking into consolidating into one PC and using Unraid because y'all have definitely kickstarted my addiction to self-hosting (thanks! :) ), but this chip shortage is driving me mad when finding parts to build my PC.
 But, having the capability of running Plex transcoded streams, and many other services in unraid, while also being able to use hot-swap hard drive bays, and have a rack-mount server form factor.
 Any reccomendations? I've been considering getting a used prebuilt and case swapping to a 2u case, but I'm worried that it would cause incompatibility issues when upgrading hardware.
 Any advice would be helpful :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was doing some research on this and couldn't find an IndieWeb solution to help merge and filter content that's coming from many sources.
 I have content that's being added in multiple places in this form:
  
URL
 Title
 Description (optional)
 Tags (optional)
  
It's very unlikely that I'll ever get to 100% self-hosted, but I want all of this content to be aggregated in a self-service solution of some kind. Then I'll be able to do more interesting filtering, reminders, automatic posting, etc.
 It becomes a little bit clearer when you look at the sources:
  
Bookmarks in pinboard.in.
 Instapaper articles.
 Notes to self as Slack messages.
 Chrome bookmarks on work machines.
 Saved Reddit posts.
 Favorites on Hacker News.
 Saved threads on Lobsters (a Reddit-like site)
 Faves on Twitter.
  
A potential solution would be to choose one of the options above, like Pinboard, and push all of the content there. That's fine in theory, but I'd need a tool, or collection of tools to push the content to that location. Pinboard is great, but I'd still have to build some additional functionality for handling automatic posting of specific content.
 It would be much better to have all of this data in the database of a self-hosted app that I can access, or hack on the app itself. It would ideally maintain connectors for all of the sources above and add more. I have yet to find such a tool and wanted to ask here. Ultimately, I think I'll have to just build something for myself.

 And it is no problem if they be several scripts.
 Although i like to know everything possible (every one that is available) 
 I mainly prefer those who can installed on free hostings that mostly support php.
 But i like to know others also.
 Thank you very much.
 Also if you know any way to mirror well knows websites to my own domain or cloudflare (i don't know any technical names but something like cname cloaking or better ways)
 for this leak detection websites (like ipleak, dnsleaktest, whoer and others) say that mirroring way please.
 Why i ask this is because most of these services are blocked by our idiot ISPs to prevent knowing their vulnerabilities.
 Thanks in advance.

 I am currently managing a small company's infrastructure and we basically have a bunch of docker containers we have to run for each application. This runs out of a single physical machine, and all configuration is done with environment variables when possible.
 The final goal is to save these configurations on a git repository to track any changes, but, how should I organize this?
 My first idea was to create a single docker-compose file, but that quickly became huge to manage. An alternative would be to create smaller docker-compose files for each application, then create a batch script to launch each of them.
 Is there a third option that I am missing? What (and why) do you do in your case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently using Nextcloud for a bunch of things (some files but not many, contacts, notes, calendar, etc) and while it works fine for this, the calendar web interface in particular is way too slow (I'm using Nginx + PHP-FPM on amd64).
 I saw this other thread that mentioned Radicale as an alternative, but Radicale doesn't have a web interface, which is important if I'm on a machine that I don't have a client installed on yet.
 Does anyone know of an alternative to Nextcloud calendar that:
  
Has a fast and responsive web interface
 Supports Caldav for syncing to client devices
 Has an import function so I can import my Nextcloud calendar
  
I don't care about any other features such as contacts or notes, because I'm happy with using Nextcloud for those for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been looking into creating a simple documentation site for my team members since my team has grown in size recently. I have tens of dozens of documents, instructions and step-by-step configurations for reference.
 The basic functionality that I'm looking for are for people to login and search for topics, view the documentation, check they've read them. Do you guys know of any such system that I can self-host in my system and share with them? I've been looking at sites like https://docusaurus.io and https://www.bookstackapp.com. 
 Am I in the right track? Or are there better ones for my needs?
 Thank you very much for your time reading this and for any responses.

 Five months ago a thread was posted about LibrePhotos and I got a lot of feature requests. I have been working on LibrePhotos since then. This is a quick update about features that got added since then:
  
Support for videos
 Basic support for RAW images
 It is now possible to find and delete missing photos
 You can now install LibrePhotos locally on Linux
 It is now possible to scan with multiple threads at once
 There is now a "Download selected photos" button
 Images for ARM64 are in testing
 You can view the REST API under /api/swagger

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are working on a project to provide a complete Google Photos alternative. There are 3 main advantages Google Photos provide:
 1- Safe and resilient to data loss
 2- Simple application interface
 3- Flexible storage
 We are working on a decentralized solution, which is indeed opensource. Solution is based on IPFS, IPLS and proxy re-encryption. Files are stored on an IPFS node, which can be synchronized with as many other nodes as user chooses to keep data safe and resilient to loss. Also data can be encrypted and saved safely on filecoin network or any normal cloud server. The node provides file management and database API through IPLD/IPFS. Developers can develop for end-users using simple-to-use APIs that are provided for each node. User can either install the open-source software on a machine manually to create a "BOX" node or purchase a "BOX" node.
 ​
 First application we made is a Google Photo replacement, which you can find here:
 functionland/photos (github.com)
 ​
 you can also read more at our website:
 https://fx.land
 I would appreciate any constructive feedback and stay tuned!

Wondering if the alternatives do this as well or have other features I'm not considering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm about to launch a WordPress website that is specific to a growing community in Austin, TX. I want this website to be as fast as possible for users who will be contributing and revising articles.
 I'm torn between using Digital Ocean's NVME droplet which the closest servers are in San Francisco, or Linode which only has SSD, but it's closest location is in Dallas. I also feel that since this is for a specific location in TX, having a TX-based location would be appreciated by users.
 So the question is: Is storage speed faster than server location? 
 I currently have several DO $5 droplets, one of which is running my personal websites. I'm happy with the service which, but that's just for me as I'm the lone admin.
 This new website is a separate venture. I expect several dozen users to be editing the site at the same time, and would like it to be very interactive and as instantaneous as possible. I plan on starting with the lowest tier options and upgrading as needed.
 Both companies offer a $100 credit for the first two months. I've considered launching both to test, but I really don't want to spend that time testing the speed, and would rather spend time with more developing and getting the site ready for it's initial launch.
 Any thoughts on this would be super helpful.
