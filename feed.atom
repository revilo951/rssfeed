        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Short version: I have a wildcard cert from LetsEncrypt that handles most of my needs.
 But there is the oddball exception.
 I was curious to see if anybody here had come across a simple internal service that lets one sign CSRs using an internal CA (more realistically a chained cert that has been signed by an airgapped CA). Or even "pre-generate" a signed cert and key combo for future use. (Getting the trusted certificate loaded onto the devices would be an exercise left to the admin.)
 Essentially, I had been planning on hacking this together using Python and Flask, but I also don't want to reinvent the wheel. Especially if the wheel is already polished, feature complete, and tested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Google thinks some people in US are not in the US, because they also have a personal VPN server at home for their family abroad. Now their home IP addresses are somewhat blocked and considered as from another country. Have you had this issue?
 ​
 DR:
 We maintain an open source software running on Raspberry Pi that allows people to self-host a shadowsocks+outline VPN server at home (https://src.we-pn.com). It's very similar to PiVPN.
 About a month ago we started hearing from different people (all living in the United States) that Google is blocking them from paid services *for themselves in US - not their relatives abroad*. 
 For example, YouTube music says "this service is not available in your country" on the person's phone, who is definitely in California (no GPS glitch, they checked). Google Pay gives a 403 forbidden response. We don't think their families were using any of these services, but can't be sure.
 We realized why this is happening once one user was logging into Google, and got 2FA notification on their phone saying they are logging in from another country. This is the country their family lives in. To eliminate the possibility of legit hack/..., they checked multiple times and it's always the same. Seems like their IP (from Comcast) is marked as being in a different country. Renewing their IP solved it, but might be temporary until Google flags them again.
 Does Anyone Else face this issue?

 Traffic may be 100k-200k/m (I don't know how much traffic I'd get - just telling this number for context)
 Please suggest me the best options.
 P.S. I'd love to go for AWS/Google cloud but seems like it's only for pros :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I finally took the courage to move one more step away from the data hungry Google and alike by renting my very first VPS. 
 It's a very basic VPS in digitalocean running Ubuntu and in which I was able to self-host my own Nextcloud server via Snap (automatic updates :] ) by following this tutorial.
 Now that I'm already paying every month for the VPS and I've built some momentum around researching about it, I would like to use my single VPS with ubuntu to run other services, such as Wallabag and maybe a personal Wiki, but so far I've been puzzled by the amount of options available to achieve what I intend.
 I heard multiple times terms such as Nginx, Traefik, Docker-Compose, ... and I wonder what would be my best bet.
 All I'm looking is for some privacy, security and ease of use so I can put all my focus on the process and not the tools :)
 I would appreciate if I could get some direction from some you that may have much more experience in self-hosting than I am.
 Thank you!!

 Example some drunk folk hits and runs killing a child. The case gets to the media but justice isnt served because of corruption or slow process. This way maybe someone has a little piece of evidence that can help (example: some local business has a camera that allows to identify make, model and color of the car, etc.).
 And how can I host it anonymously to keep myself safe.

I was already thinking about Nextcloud / Owncloud / Radicale but unfortunately they are based on one main hardware and not syncthing on several devices. Personally, I think a decentralized network has more advantages than a centralized computer network structure. That is why I am looking for solutions involving network decentralization, because then I have control over everything working on any computer / laptop. I hope that you will help me find interesting solutions based on a decentralized network. Thanks!

 I'm trying to figure this out for a while and I seem to be out of luck. I am running NPM with Portainer and MailCow mail server. There are lots of exposed ports to the outside (portainer 9000, mailcow UI on ports 83, etc.) and I don't think these need to be published to the outside. Isn't the whole idea of having the proxy manager to have only 80 and 443 ports open and the rest to be accessible only from localhost?
 Anyone has any idea how do I achieve this? 
 I've tried editing the mailcow nginx container and remove the published ports, but the IP won't get assigned and it's not working at all. Any workaround?
 Thanks in advance for any help!

I am not very good with css/html or UI design in general so I am looking for something that has a lot of that already done and I just need to tell it where to put things and tie my python app in to it. Being a programmer I can figure out the JS/api to the library/coponents. Can anyone offer suggestions of web UI frontend with a library of components that can be used out of the box from a design perspective? 
 I think my layout will be kind of similar to VS code (or other IDEs) with a list of files on the left, tabs and code editor. Some status icons at the top(or bottom). I want to use Ace or code mirror for the editor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the NordVPN apps there is a type of connection called Obfuscated Server which is meant to conceal the fact that you're using a VPN from endpoints that you visit. This is the relevant bit from the link:
  
Obfuscated servers are used to bypass VPN-blocking firewalls. To do that, a VPN provider must remove all information related to a VPN from your data so that it looks like regular data packets. 
 VPN providers can obfuscate data in a few different ways. For example, data packets can be hidden using additional SSL/SSH encryption so that all the VPN metadata is out of sight. Think of it as encryption to conceal your encryption. 
 Data can also be scrambled, hiding the metadata from the packet header. This way, it looks like regular HTTPS traffic filled with meaningless information. Firewalls can’t recognize it, so they let it pass.
  
Question is: How can I implement this from my home server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there. I'm new to self hosting and have spent the last few days doing some research, however I still have a lot of stuff I couldn't figure out. I figured it's best I mention my use case so here goes:
  
Plex server: I haven't decided on plex as such but seeing as it's the most common, I might start with it. I'm okay with using Kodi/Emby/Jellyfin as well. My main issue with this is that I'm only going to be storing 4k media. Ideally transcoding wouldn't be required, but I've read that plex transcodes for a variety of reasons (like picture based subtitles). Ideally I would only direct play but just to be safe, I'd like to be able to do 1-2 4k transcodes.
 Smarthome: This is the part that I haven't done any research on so excuse me if something doesn't make sense. From my understanding I'll need a server to act make everything play nice with each other. I'd like to be able to do this.
 Seedbox: I'm currently seeding about 60TB of "linux iso's". This is spread across 20k torrents. I'd want to move all this to the new server.
 File transfer: Simple way to share stuff between all my devices.
 Security system: Camera's would output and store locally in this server.
  
This is all I can think of for now but I'm pretty sure I'd need to expand in the future. Now my main question is what kind of server would I require for this?
 I'm pretty sure points 2, 4 and 5 would barely take any resources. 1 and 3 would be the main focus. Would you recommend buying 1 beefy server or multiple smaller ones? I'd ideally want to run all this off a single synology nas but I don't know if that's possible.
 Oh and it's also worth mentioning that I live in a studio apartment so I wouldn't want a noisy server. That pretty much eliminates most Xeons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear reddit,
 I'm Rodolfo Berrios, creator of Chevereto which is a self-hosted image sharing solution.
 Chevereto V3.20 has been released, which is the final release in V3.X as Chevereto V4 will be released on September 2021! This release closes the cycle started in 2014 and brings massive user interface improvements, deprecates JS based effects, brings container support (real deal), improves performance, fixes tons of bugs and introduces a new testing standard. Check the Release announcement for a more granular description of the changes implemented in this one and the feedback that we got.
 💖 Chevereto is very small 2-person team from Chile and for about a while we have been building our next-gen stuff which we will start to unwrap very soon.
 Feel free to ask me your questions, also suggest me stuff you will like to see in Chevereto 😉
 Bonus: Chevereto-Free users will be happy to know that there are Future plans for Chevereto-Free

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I am dating myself here, but does anybody here remember the old Novell Netware screensavers? It has a red snake that runs around, and depending on CPU and IO load, the length of the snake changes. It's great being able to just briefly glance at a montior from far away, to see how much load my system is going through. Also, if you have more than one CPU core, you can have a different colored snake for the other core. 
 My question is, does such a similar screensaver exist for Linux shells? I remember back in the late 90s, there was a Windows type screensaver for it, but it was really blurry and nowhere as authentic as the original.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello: right now I've got two containers that are running. A seafile container, and a gitlab container. I use nginx on the host system to proxy these, one of these containers (seafile) I installed using docker-compose, the others I have not (gitlab had a longish string for installation you needed to use). I didn't publish the ports, but left them default. When I look at posts I see people using lots of other docker containers to monitor/manage/configure their docker containers, and I'm a bit confused. I will be adding more containers for sure, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. These are services I'm using just for myself. What is the best unified way to manage these that isn't going to get me super far into the weeds learning a ton of new technologies?
 I also have various other questions: Is there a way to somehow have a reverse proxy that publishes itself that the docker containers register themselves with? Will this support letsencrypt/etc? Right now, I have a subdomain per docker container because that was the easiest way to configure nginx reverse proxying, but if there's a service that I can use to do this that would be helpful. I'm not opposed to swapping nameservers.
 I'm sorry this post is super scrambled and all over the place, I've spent a day trying to learn this and find myself more and more confused as I go along. Any tips/ideas would be welcome. Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, sorry it this isn't the right sub for this kind of question, feel free to direct me to a better suited sub. 
 So, I've tried a few tutorials in the past that go about it, but I've never managed to get it fully working, most that I got is making a apparently working wg tunel between my RPi & the VPS. Then I let it go... 
 Now, about a year later however, I've decided to give it another shot, and I'm hoping I'll find someone willing to help me, if some unexpected trouble arise, that quick googling couldn't easily solve. 
 So, my current "setup":
 I'm behind cg NAT, so no public IP, obviously.
 ​
 I wanted to start off clean, so:
 I have RPI4 available, I can install any supported os that you'd recommend, tho I'm pretty much counting on Raspbian lite (just that the last time I had to compile the wg for it from scratch, so, I hope i won't need to do that again...). 
 I have my lite VPS running CentOS 7, also in a completely clean state, so far only purpose would be hosting the wg server. 
 I'd normally just go with the "first" tutorial that google would find, but given that it pretty much didn't work out last time(s) I've been trying it, here I am, writing this post... 
 So, if somebody has got a "tried & true, verified working and not 3 years old" tutorial working, for exactly this purpose, (exposing services from LAN) I'm down to just following it. 
 But since I want to get it finally fully working this time, I figured I'll make a post, since honestly, I know a bit of Linux, and stuff, but god damn, sometimes I feel like I'm dense af... 
 So... anybody with a bit of spare time to help this noobish fool, set this up?

 My YNH instance is accessible from outside, everything works fine. I tried installing the redirect app to use it as a reverse proxy to access my NCPi from outside, but I guess I don't know how to configure it as it forwards to my local address (192.168.1.x) and I can only access it from home.
 I have a dedicated domain name for my NCPi instance.

I'm plan on setting them up to be a docker swarm or kubernetes cluster since those are two things I'd like to learn. Beyond that however I have no clue on what to actually host. I already have a Cloudbox instance running on some other servers, so please don't suggest anything that that has bundled with it.

 Now I want to allow the user to upload a video. But due to the high cost of video hosting, I am looking for a free solution for hosting videos.
 A solution comes to my mind:
 Publish video uploaded to my YouTube channel via API. But the problem is that if the content is illegal, YouTube will ban my channel. Isn't true?
 ​
 My question is:
  
Is there a solution to this YouTube problem?
 Is there an even more complex free solution other than using YouTube?

 has someone successfully installed rocket.chat via docker using official docker compose file, as is?
 I'm enough noob on docker, so I have not understood all parameters... by the way, the stack starts but when I access the first time, it propose my the account admin creation process (some steps...) but even if I fill in the form it doesn't continue. If I restart, it open directly the login page, such as the admin creation has been completed... but putting the admin user and password of course it does not work.
 Looking at the log of the container I just see some error when try to connect to mongodb container but then they seems solved (I think the rocket.chat try several time until mongodb is up); I see also error on another container that create a bot user to chat with as a test... but I do not think it is critical.
 Suggestions?

 Does that make sense? 
 What should I be looking for and are there any "buts" or downsides?

 I am currently experimenting with Nextcloud on a Pi4 4GB + 512 GB SSD as a docker image integration on Open Media Vault on Raspberry Pi OS.
 I have decided i want to host the following for around 5 users (decreasing order of importance):
  
Next cloud - ideally not facing the internet
 VPN to home network (facing internet)
 Pi Hole for whole network (facing internet)
 Matrix (for family only with federation turned off)
 Jitsi (facing internet)
 Email
 Wallabang
 Kodi - ideally not facing the internet and
 SearX
  
Is it ideal I use multiple Pis to achieve this or do I set it up on a single Ryzen 5/7 machine. (If the latter, docker (Should I consider something like YunoHost?) vs VMs which would be better?, I won't need to scale anything except for storage in the future as the number of users is gonna be fixed)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I wasn't to clarify -- I'm not wanting DNS to add a specific port. I know that's not supported in the wild.
 If I have multiple devices that utilize the same ports, can a DNS record be used to direct the traffic to the proper device?
 As an example: a service runs on port 123. Three internal LAN devices all use port 123. Can I setup my DNS such that I can route to a specific device and avoid port forwarding?
 foo A 192.168.1.10 bar B 192.168.1.51 yop C 192.168.5.20 
 Thus by requesting foo.example.com:123, it would automatically route to 192.168.1.10:123?and yop.example.com:123 would give 192.168.5.20:123?
 This seems like it should work, but I've been unable to implement it successfully on my DNS Server. Incoming traffic from the internet does not seem to utilize the internal DNS server. Is there a way to make incoming traffic get direction from my internal DNS?
 In fact, it seems like my DNS records do nothing for redirecting incoming traffic.

Samba: It's basically an AD Domain Controller which was more than I needed; also while being feature-familiar with AD is nice, I'm not looking to implement AD, I'm looking to really stick closer to just LDAP.
 GLAuth: Interesting project, but is somewhat limited in the attributes it can handle, how group management works, how the OU structure is reflected in group membership, and usability. GLauth-ui is an interesting component …]]></summary>

On that VM, i have about 20 docker containers running, including (but not limited too) Home assistant, Node Red, Pihole, Heimdal, Grocy, Organizr, Portainer, Grafana, InfluxDB, Zwave2Mqtt, ESPHome and some others.
 ​
 This afternoon, Im no longer able to access any of the web addresses, the folders shared via samba, or even SSH into the virtual machine. I can still access it on my virtual box when connecting to the mac mini. I've tried restarting and shutting down the VM, and even restarting services. Any idea what other options exist to try and get these functioning?
 I should mention that the docker containers are definitely running. And i can access home assistant through nabucasa. And automations and alexa integrations still work. I just can't access any services using the VM IP or Samab or SSH
 Never had to troubleshoot linux like this before. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks for any ideas and help.

 Does anyone know of self-hosted software that would achieve this?
 I figured a finances manager, like firefly iii can be used to track the items as assets, but it would be nice if there's something more specific for this use case.

 I'm very exited to share with you how how I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps left by the death of google play music : the lack of possibility to synchronize playlists in an efficient way
 As google play music user my main usage was to upload my music and use it to download albums, artists or playlistson my mobile. Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.
 The solution I'm presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn't put all my brain cells into it)).
 What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)
 You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync
 I'm really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)
 I hope it will be useful to some people. Whether it's using the solution I propose or a solution based on the same principle but better suited to your own needs.
 I am of course open to all discussions and suggestions.
 PS : I'm not a native english speaker, I do my best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[title, I've been working on this on-off the last 2 years, but most progress was made the last year (lockdown amiright).
 The point is to scan your local NSFW videos & images and provide a way to organize all of that stuff. Makes it easy to search for specific content (unwatched scenes, bookmarks, ratings etc) (like: "show me all videos I've never watched featuring blondes" or whatever). Media can then be accessed by any device with a web browser.
 The app supports videos (scenes), actors/actresses, movies, studios (including substudios, networks), images and scene chapters (markers). Future versions will also support image albums.
 It scales very nicely, doesn't matter if you just have a couple of files or 10s of TB of data.

 I am lookign for a self-hosted app that has good random photo features like creating clickable random gallery / picture wall from the root folder or from the current gallery. 
  
It can create random gallery on demand
 It can create random gallery based on the currently open gallery
 It can access to the local files (so no database import)
  
I use Piwigo for this but the random stuff is very limited, and it pulls from the root albums so %95 of the the time that is not what I need. Also it does not look like there is a way to number of photo shown, it is a fixed number.
 I do not want to use static page generators since I need this stuff to be generated on demand, static page gens are useless in this case.
 thanks

 Heres the issue.
 ssh PC ---> New Server : ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh PC ----> Old server: works
 ssh Old Server ----> New Server: works
 ssh Mobile phone ----> New Server: works
 ssh New Server----> Old Server: works
 ssh Old Server---> PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Refused This makes sense
 ssh New Server ---> PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh Mobile ---->PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 Things I've tried:
  
Restarting all the machines involved
 Restarting the ssh client on the new server
 Turning off all the firewalls (PC and New Server)
 Enabling ssh on UFW
 Tried Reinstalling the ssh client on the new server (This changed the fingerprint, but the old server could still connect to get the changed host error)
 Pinging the New Server from the PC works. Same ping as to the old one.
  
Things I've done to the new server:
  
Apt update && apt upgrade
 apt install nvidia-headless-460-server
 echo "blacklist floppy" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-floppy.conf Do to an I/O error I dont't have a floppy
  
That's it. That is all I've done since a clean install on bare metal. The whole thing is running on a btrfs file system if that matters. I haven't enabled any encryption or anything else yet.
 This ssh service on the new server logs events for the clients that work but nothing at all coming from the PC. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea why it isn't working. I didn't test the ssh prior to the three changes above so I do not know if this was an issue previously.
 Both the old and the new server are running off the same installation image of Ubuntu server 20.04
 I would really like to get this working since I almost exclusively interact with the server using VScode on the PC.

 For fpm docker images, what's the difference between images that use alpine and those that don't?
 I'm aware that alpine is one of the leanest containers out there, but is there any drawback from using alpine in production?
 If not, then why don't all apps just skip fpm and go straight for fpm-alpine instead of giving the option for non alpine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have decided to re-setup my self hosted services. Runs under docker with traefik(1.7) as a reverse proxy/ssl provider (lets encrypt). traefik has a middle ware thing called traefik-forward-auth that allows you to tap into an oauth provider to secure your services. One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.
 I don't like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I'm being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.
 I'm curious how other people have this set up?
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is all my setup I went through over a few days of trial and error to get myself a proper sandbox'd environment for my cameras.
 I have multiple Reolink cameras connected by a PoE switch to my Raspberry pi, which acts as a DHCP server for them and runs Shinobi as the cam software.
 All camera viewing then has to be performed through the Shinobi software, which is hosted instead off my local subnet.
 The trick is utilizing the Raspberry Pi's wifi module + its ethernet port, allowing you to sandbox off the cameras to the Ethernet subnet (and thus requires a direct physical connection to access their data), and then view the camera footage over the wifi subnet (through your home router)
 I also have a NGINX configured reverse proxy server I use, as I have a website domain I host my stuff off of, which lets me access shinobi from anywhere (but requires login of course)
 Result: DIY Reverse Proxied Sandbox'd DVR
 Let me know if you have any questions!
 Step by Step Guide Link: https://gist.github.com/SteffenBlake/93d442c0413425112e17de8e13642215
 Software:
  
PuTTY to SSH into the Raspbery Pi from Windows
 Raspbian Lite OS on the Pi
 UFW Firewall
 NGINX Reverse Proxy
 isc-dhcp-server for DHCP serving IPs to the sandbox'd cameras
 Shinobi for the Camera Dashboard

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for suggestions on software, or even ideas on how to plan this out.
 We're moving house and we need new furniture for everything since our current place has it all provided.
 I was thinking of a Kanban board of some kind. Maybe one board for each room and each big item could be a "ticket" (sofa/fridge etc). Then I could have To Buy/Bought/Delivered for each column and drag each item as needed. Suggestions for each item could be added as comments.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Or is there any other way people could think to organise something like this? I would love it if there were metadata that could be assigned to each item, so I could have a cost associated to a ticket then for each room I could see how much has been spent etc.
 Whatever solution has to be able to support images on tickets. Ideally I have to get my fiance to use and if the UI is not somewhat pretty/modern I know for a fact she won't use it, no matter how good it is. I’m not sure on Kanban because I need mobile for this and from what I’ve seen a lot of them aren’t responsive on an iPhone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there - I'm pretty new to things like this but I was wondering if anyone may be able to help me.
 Say I have a webapp and I'm using something like localhost.run to expose this app that's running on my local port 5000.
 I run something like:
 ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 localhost.run 
 and now have a nice little link like:
 https://081e35c0012dd4.localhost.run 
 that I can share with the world. This seems nice, but also very insecure. Is it possible to secure this a bit more - namely without needing to self host my own server. In this case localhost.run is taking a lot of the work out of maintaining my own server and things are quite easy.
 One of my use cases is testing webhooks. For example, say the webhooks I'm testing publish which IP addresses you can expect the requests to be coming from. How would I go about allowlisting only these IP addresses to access my newly exposed app, if at all possible?
 Thanks!

A reverse proxy should take care of redirecting external incoming request to the appropriate webserver. But I am unsure about the internal clients. Should they also use the reverse proxy (Variant 1) or connect directly to the webservers (Variant 2)?
 What is your best practice?
 How do you handle certificates?
 I am fan of having the same url for external and internal clients and using offical CAs (like LetsEncrypt) for internal FQDNs. Thanks anyone for your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been happily running all my selfhosted stuff on a headless Ubuntu Server using VirtualBox for almost a decade now. While I've got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there's newer tech that is far more convenient. I'm super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) & allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I'm not even aware of! I'm less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.
 ​
 While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh & the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!
 ​
 I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I'm under the impression that the default used to be K8 & Docker & Ansible, but now it seems that K8 & Docker don't play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?
 ​
 Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management. I also run LDAP (not whole home) & 3 node Galera Cluster (HA MariaDB).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We are using OnlyOffice self hosted but only as groupware email solution - we have around 100 users, and every user has 2-5 external mailboxes connected via imap to external mail server. OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:
  
Nextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).
 Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.
 Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.
 Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. 
 Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don't want to move mx'es to our new self hosted.
  
So, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:
  
Create users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.
 Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.
 Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.
 It's ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.
  
Many thanks for any suggestions!

I have looked at and rejected Mattermost (doesn't have the permissions I need) and Rocket.Chat (has half the permissions but runs too slow). 
 What I really need is a chat server that can be used to restrict file uploads to specific rooms or user roles, and, at the very least, has the capability to create an 'arrivals' system, where users show up to a single room before being invited to the chat at large. My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don't want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. 
 I'm currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it's unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't used it, Tailscale solves so many problems with connectivity / port forwarding / security. Run it on all your machines and log in, and they're all connected and their hostnames resolve (i.e. http://mycomputer:8080). It solves One Problem, with absolutely zero config headache. I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don't mind that Tailscale isn't fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way
 It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you'd want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)
 I have no association with the project btw, I'm solely an extremely happy free-tier user

Ubuntu server => Windows 10 PC
 
Ubuntu server => Ubuntu server
 
 The server does have a 450 Mbits uplink connection and I'm looking for a program that actually uses the full bandwidth of the uplink, with parallel connections automatically. So, if you initiate a transfer, it should really saturate the uplink with as many parallel connections until the 450 Mbits bandwidth is used to the fullest.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
