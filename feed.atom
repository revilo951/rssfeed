        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some help in figuring out where I am going wrong. 
 I would like to have access to home assistant outside my home as well as setting up Google assistant without relying on the Nabu Casa cloud service. 
 I have registered a domain through Google domains and updated Google domains to point to CloudFlare name servers. 
 I have the free tier CloudFlare account. I have A records for both root and www for my domain pointing to my IP address. 
 I have the port forwarding rules setup in my router. 
 However, I cannot for the life of me get it to work. 
 <IP address>:12345 correctly goes to my home assistant log in page. 
 <Domain>:12345 just times out or gives a CloudFlare 522 error. 
 Is there something else I should be running on my end?
 Many thanks in advance!

 I got Docker installed, the Calibre image downloaded and running and even got Calibre configured through my Windows browser yesterday. It created the folder hierarchy under Docker/Calibre too. 
 Now the bad news. I realized that I rushed through the Calibre install and wanted to change some settings and folder destinations. I also considered installing Calibre Web instead. I figured I'd be able to just 're-install' Calibre on the NAS and I could re-install the Calibre app from the browser again. No LUCK! 
 I got the Calibre imaging running on Docker again, but can't get to the Calibre app install on the Windows browser. The browser window throws, 'The connection has timed out. The server at 192.1.0.xxx is taking too long to respond.' 
 What additional information can I supply to help folks to point me to a solution? Basic Docker or Calibre tutorials for me to reference? I admit I have little Docker knowledge and just followed instructions posted. 
 Or, maybe it's time to do a COMPLETE removal to get back to where I can do a clean install. Maybe uninstall Docker too. I feel like I don't know which end of the ball of string to start pulling on. 
 Thanks, T

 it does almost everything I want, except it has very little control. for instance, I passed it the wrong argument to set the download location, and there is no way to alter it via the web frontend, nor cli commands. I ended up restoring a checkpoint on the VM and reinstalling, only to find out it still adds a 'videos' folder within the download folder, which throws off plex from grabbing the videos.
 are there similar alternatives out there? I don't want to have to destroy the entire app or rollback my VM host to reconfigure minor things

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm going to be setting up some kind of a NAS/server for a new small business within the next month or so, and I'm weighing my options - currently trying to decide between a pre-built Synology (likely a DS1621+) vs. a custom build server based on a Ryzen 3rd gen running TrueNAS Core + NextCloud. 
 Some of the requirements:
  
The system needs to be remotely accessible in the field via mobile data / wifi
 Our use case will mostly involve PDFs and other small documents, but will occasionally include higher-res pictures being uploaded from the field
 The end-user apps need to be easy to use, most of our employees will be contractors who aren't very savvy
 I will need to control permissions for different users / user groups
  
The office will have a symmetrical gigabit network connection, and I plan to set up a domain with dynamic DNS + Let's Encrypt no matter which option I choose. I'll be running real time backups through BackBlaze B2 + weekly updates to an external drive.
 I run unRAID at home for a Plex Server with ~120TB of storage, and it's rock solid. But I'm looking elsewhere as the I/O capability of that system isn't great, and in this case it's likely multiple people will be reading and writing data throughout the day. I'm also considering using SSD storage for better local read/write speeds, which effectively removes unRAID as an option. Finally, while I'm happy to tinker in my spare time, whatever I end up setting up here will need to basically run itself, as my role will involve a hell of a lot more than just managing the IT infrastructure. 
 So, to summarize - I know I can build a cheaper NAS with a lot more horsepower than what I'd buy from Synology - but I'm worried that NextCloud will require too much ongoing maintenance to make it worthwhile. Thoughts?

 ​
 Lychee version is 4.3.2 
 Edit #1:
 I've quickly updated to 4.3.4 but nothing changed in terms of being unable to access settings 
 Edit #2: It turns out that it only doesn't work on Firefox. After checking browser console it seems that some classes uses private class fields and probably this causes error.
 Anyway - settings are accessible on Edge so I'll mark that as solved

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pretty new to computer networking so I don't know if my plan even is feasible, but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and maybe better suggestions on how to achieve off-site back-ups.
 I want to: * deploy a remote server at my friend's house that only I can access * upload back-ups to this server from my home server periodically to have off-site back-ups * create a solution that sets itself up without me interfering, i.e. only power and internet needed and no router configuration either since I don't want to mess with my friend's router
 (Bonus: server appears to be on my local network)
 I am guessing a site-to-site (or rather server-to-site) VPN solution with e.g. Wireguard could work. I just don't know if my requirements are sensible. Can I actually deploy a server like that without messing with any router configurations like e.g. port forwarding? I can't think of how I can do this without forwarding Wireguard's VPN port on my friend's router. 
 An alternative to this is of course renting a cloud storage service in e.g. Azure and use that as an off-site cool storage. But I want to explore some self-hosted solutions as well.
 Any help is appreciated.

 Not sure what to do about the endpoint, as it seems to require something like SERVER_WAN_IP_ADDRESS:LISTEN_PORT. Is there a way to overcome this, or is this setup not possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to configure Nginx Proxy Manager to redirect traffic from my domain to a port on my network.
 for example:
 x.com -> 192.168.178.46:8080 x.com/A -> 192.168.178.46:8123 x.com/B -> 192.168.178.10:80 
 I am able to set up remote access for this using subdomains such as (a.x.com) however I would prefer to use custom locations over subdomains. 
 Settings:
 Details Page
 Custom Locations Page
 Interestingly, when I navigate to x.com/A, after the connection times out, in the address bar it seems I was redirected to x.com:4443/A. I cannot find any reason for this. 
 My nginx docker is configured to use port 1880 for http, and 18443 for https, and my router redirects the forward ports accordingly
 I've found another user with a similar issue Here but unfortunately no fix.
 On the same message board, I also found this, which seems to be exactly what I'm trying to set up, but just does not work for me, for whatever reason.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 I also want to use this domain to host some web services, but I think the email forwarding is interfering with the domain redirection.
 I can access my server at www.mydomain.com or *.mydomain.com but simply mydomain.com doesn't work - it goes to my registrar. I have an @.mydomain.com A record set.
 So...is my registrar overriding my A records so that email forwarding will work? Is there a work around so I can use the same domain for both hosting and email redirection?

I have recently been diving into the selfhosted world, and have set up some game servers (minecraft, space engineers) as systemd services on a debian machine. I would like to be able to turn these on and off, as well see their current status from my browser, without needing to SSH into the server. Obviously I would create an unprivileged user with restricted access for this purpose, but my google-fu has been failing and I haven't been able to find any software that fits this use case. The server also has nginx serving some static pages, and I have the technical ability to create some webpages that call an api on my server, the question is what can I use to host those APIs? If anyone knows any software that can do this I'm all ears. Otherwise I might be making my own (and probably open-sourcing it) software or script to handle this. I appreciate any suggestions anyone has (software, methods, security, anything)

 I have tried the following two guides and failed miserably which I will describe in a second as to why:
 Tried this one since I heard OpenBSD is good for security, and I was up for the challenge. Looked OK at the first, but damn this post is way too intense near the end, and was so jenky. Plus SMTP isn't described on how to truly configure it. It basically felt like, "Here's me rambling. Oh yeah, here's my Gmail, should just work, Ok? Bye", not good at all in my opinion:
 https://poolp.org/posts/2019-09-14/setting-up-a-mail-server-with-opensmtpd-dovecot-and-rspamd/
 Failed at this one since I deployed a 512MB based Vultr VPS running Debian 10, didn't know you need at least 2GB for this setup, so really, this is me being cheap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fairphone, Pinephone, Librem5 and others are all a response to limitations of phones such as the iPhone walled garden and Android's increasing surveillance capitalism, principally via GApps and also its push for everything to go through the cloud. 
 This is theoretical, because I doubt many people carry 2 portable devices like a battery pack already but a portable network mitigate some of this hassle?
 Some of the benefits:
 1) get past the limitations of a glued-in battery because you're not connecting via WiFi
 2) get past the limitations of limited storage by syncing to 'the cloud', which is actually just the router in your pocket. Then sync and clear it when you get home.
 3) get past some of the legal limitations for the radio chip. Fairphone and Pinephone still need a black box GSM chip. While any router does too, at least it opens up possibilities to swap it out for new developments.
 4) get past the limitation of having only one vpn slot. Monitor AND shape your traffic with the flexibility of Linux.
 5) no simcard = at least you know the phone is definitely off and not transmitting. Similar to hardware kill switches
 6) get past some walled garden restrictions on apple when combined with censorship. Let's say you're in China but apple had to delete some anti surveillance app from the app store? The portable router could host that.
 7) everything's going via the cloud these days. Get past Google's push for that with a local server. For example, the browser can't access the local file system anymore. Make a filesystem available via a Web service running on the router. *Save bandwidth and lag. *
 I'm sure there's a lot more that can be thought of. 
 Drawbacks:
 1) carrying 2 things 2) maybe all (some?.?) of this is too battery intensive?

 From what I've seen, however, most applications that have helm charts are abandoned.
 What is a solution? Write my own helm charts? Write my own kubernetes config yamls and manually apply them? Just give up and use docker?
 Just wondering if anyone's bothered with something similar and how you handled it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Caddy and I'm trying to reverse proxy my self hosted services (jellyfin and komga) to subdomains.
 As far as I understand, if those domains are pointed to my IP address (which is dynamic, so I had to setup dynamic dns) and ports 80 and 443 are forwarded, Caddy should do all the work automatically: creating the subdomains and providing ssl certificates.
 So let's say my caddyfile is something like
 ​
 jellyfin.mydomain.xyz {
 reverse_proxy localhost:8080
 }
 ​
 going to jellyfin.mydomain.xyz gets me nowhere. The website just doesn't exist.
 If I enable a wildcard alias then it just brings me to where mydomain.xyz points, that is to say my IP address, without specifying any port.
 Do I have to set something from the domain? Is it Caddy's fault?

 Does something like this exist? The idea is that if I need to ssh into multiple machines I only need to enter my password once rather than several times.

 But when I am at home I do not want to route the traffic through the vps first, but just through my own home network. Is this possible? Should I set some DNS records for this to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 As of late i have been looking into trying k3s, right now I use docker/docker-compose and it works amazing for what i need but I wanna try and dip my toes into k3s but I have some questions.
 Firstly, is it a good idea for me to do this? I dont have a pi cluster or anything like that, right now all i have is one VM running docker and all of my services and it does its job just fine but I am planning on getting a VPS for a project and was thinking of linking them having the VPS become the "master".
 Secondly, if yes can k3s be ran on varying hardware? What I mean by that is, im not going to get a VPS with the same specs as what is allocated to my VM and if I plan to add another machine to it in the future (ie a rpi) can it be done? 
 This is a interesting concept but not sure if it will be worth it for what I am doing.
 Cheers for the help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not entirely sure this is the best subreddit for this but it's the best I could think of and is at least somewhat related.
 Where I work the POS software we use is very outdated, I can't remember the name of it but it's essentially breaking down: random errors, stops connecting to the printer for seemingly no reason, and is hard to update details because data appears to be stored in multiple databases with no rhyme or reason.
 A quick Google and Github search has lead me to a few options but the goals and objectives of some of the projects are far above anything we need, and a lot on Google are obviously paid and under license.
 So I would like to know if anyone can recommend a good, simple POS service for a bar. Basic needs are food, drink, opens the till, print Z's, and that's about it, my boss appears to keep control of stock and inventory seperately.
 Also if it runs on Windows 7, that'd be better, although not strictly necessary.

 Practical example: Redis. Tons of applications require Redis. For example NextCloud or Authelia. Do you have a single Redis service that is used by all applications or do you use dedicated Redis instances for every single application?
 Example
 It of course does not stop with Redis. Same story for SQL databases. So I have many MariaDBs in parallel or a single one?
 ​
 Example
 In my case I have a beefy single node server and I host most of my stuff in a Kubernetes cluster.

 I am making this post so hopefully others do not make the same mistake and to help spread awareness.
 Recently I've been helping the small family business transition to using technology (computers) which has been ran by my aunts and uncles for the past 60 years. During this entire time they've only used paper for the accounting and other financial tasks which I am now trying to help them move away from. They eventually asked if I could make a simple website for them and I said sure.
 First I wanted to see if the name for the business had been registered already. Google searched "domain name search" and the first result was namecheap. I go to the website to check and unsurprisingly it has not been taken. It was late so I decided I would work on it tomorrow but I ended up getting busy with some stuff and forgot about it for a couple days. 1-3 days pass and I go back to register it and I'm shocked to see "This domain has recently been registered". I do some further digging and found that the domain had never been registered once before. But coincidentally "someone" decided to register the domain using their service just a day or two after I had searched for it.
 To clarify, the business name is very unique and there is no business or service with anything similar or close to it. I contacted namecheap and they want hundreds of dollars for me to buy it. It's been a couple months and the domain is still parked and redirects to nothing other than their blank template "This domain is registered at namecheap" with a bunch of ads.

 I never had a real NAS before so I might be underestimating it.

 As many of you might now already, wreeto has an open source and a SaaS instance. I've been working on both (they're separate repos with big differences). Last year, I decided to invest the 100% of my time to develop the SaaS instance of the project.
 There were a lot of failures following this decision:
  
it requires quite a lot of time for me daily/weekly in terms of operations, server maintenance, security, deployments plus other stuff which is taken off development time
 it's harder to build a community and share my knowledge management vision with other people like me, I'm not a salesman, a marketeer, an entrepreneur or an investor. I know how to code and I want to invest all my time…]]></summary>

or should I just use one OS (Centos or Ubuntu) for everything?

 We need to be able to have general chit chat, separate important chat (e.g. arranging events) and perhaps community features like a calendar, photo upload, linking to our social profiles etc.
 What would be the best thing to use here? Some options I am consdiering are Mastodon, RocketChat and Riot/Matrix.
 Requirements:
  
Really good on mobile. An app is necessary really.
 
Easy to self host. I've got experience hosting things off docker images using Portainer, but not much more than that.
 
 Quick rundown of what I've seen so far:
 https://movim.eu/ - looks great but no iOS app.
 https://agorakit.org/en/ - as above - no apps.
 https://www.humhub.com/ - probably the closest to what i want. No apps but need to check their mobile browser experience.

 I just want something small that will automatically detect when a file has been added to a directory (so, a file that I downloaded 10 seconds ago and want to watch now should show up immediately and automatically) and a very good web player.
 I actually LOVE the media player built into edge that loads automatically when you click on a direct file link because, at least for me, it's buffering speed is on par with Netflix. A clone of that or an app that uses the built in player would be cool. 
 Thanks for your time. :)

 I recently found this alternative to grammarly called LanguageTool which is open source and most importantly for this sub, self-hostable. I won’t much further into the specific features of LanguageTool because I just set this up and I thought it was too good not to share, I’ve linked their homepage below. LangaugeTool Homepage
 The entire proof reading engine can be run either through their Java server or in a docker image. Java
 Docker
 Another Docker Repo
 If you’re trying to set this up yourself I ran into one error that was undocumented but an easy fix. In the add on where u put in your server address make sure to put /v2 on the end or else it will result in the server getting a null request.
 Hopefully y’all find this helpful. Happy self-hosting

Friends can join and use the text chat feature, but we can't see or hear each other. I can see myself and get a "mic working" signal, and when I use the Jitsi android app to connect to the server while on the same network, it works. But the same android off of wifi seems to have no media transfer.
 The guide I follow to set it up is here, however I deviated by using Traefik instead of Nginx: Link
 I barely understand how Traefik works myself, though I managed to get Jellyfin to work perfectly with it. In Portainer I managed to get my service accessible to everyone by simply connecting all 4 Jitsi containers plugged into my "web" network which is managed by Traefik. I'm thinking that my problem lies in here somewhere but I'm not sure. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone,
 I've never released code or software to a group of people before but I'm pushing myself to do it, I am definitely a noob when it comes to coding.
 Out of paranoia, I decided to make a piece of software that would notify me if my computer was logged into or unlocked on my Windows machines. I've put together something that will take a photo from a webcam as well as various screenshots and send it to me in an email.
 I figured this could be useful for others as well and with the advice from a friend, I added a settings file of sorts so others could use it as well without having to learn to code or recompile it every time they make changes. Thanks, u/kizaing
 The Github Repo for this is https://github.com/vicelikedust/Login-Notifier
 Upon the first run of the executable, it will register itself with the Windows Task Scheduler. 
 I believe I have exposed enough settings in the creds.json file, if not I gladly welcome suggestions and or people contributing to the repo. Again, I'm a total noob here, so I will have to learn how the merging process works if contributions come in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a home server (let's call it Server A) running a handful of services (eg. Nextcloud). I can access it fine when I'm on my local network and use its local IP address. Never ran into any issues but then again I haven't been away from my house in the last year and half.
 Recently I was working away from home and noticed Nextcloud wasn't syncing. So I tried the other services and none could be accessed. Connection time out, every time. I've been trying to fix for a few days now but can't seem to figure out the problem. I checked my firewall settings: the ports are open. I checked my router: the ports are forwarded properly. I'm pretty new to this so I don't know what else to check.
 I have another server (Server B) that's hosting a website, which can be accessed remotely. But it's got a domain name and DDNS set up, whereas when I access Server A, I just type in my home (external) IP. Maybe this has something to do with it?
 Any advice how I can troubleshoot or fix this?
 For info's sake: Server OS is Manjaro Firewall is UFW (used to be iptables but I disabled it because it was too complicated for me)

 Does anyone know of a self hosted notification service, similar to AWS's offering?
 In my dream world it would be a configurable server which, when hit with a web API request, could send the body of the request to a number of predefined outputs, e.g: email, push notification, SMS, call etc...
 I don't expect it to perform these functions, but rather be pluggable into any output you want, provided it can be ran as a program.
 Let me know if anyone knows anything in this space (I almost hope the answer is no so I have a fun project :) )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evening all, 
 So through work I've been playing with various identity solutions like AWS Cognito, Forgerock and Auth0 and I've found identity to be an interesting subject so i've been playing with said products and OAuth2 in general.
 Being a fellow self-hoster and home-labber, I thought it would be cool if I could sign into my self-hosted, jenkins, gitea, grafana and portainer with some form of central identity. I know you can happily host keycloak to achieve what I'm describing, but I thought why not have a go at making my own identity provider...so I did.
 So I've built a service called Gatekeeper that I'm hoping the people of this subreddit may find useful for your labs. It's not the most feature rich service at the moment but I'm trying to add new features wherever I can. You can see what features it has on the README in the link above, but it currently supports
  
User registration
 User login with TOTP MFA
 Email verification via 
 AWS SES
 Mailgun
 (more providers to come)
 
 See what third party apps you authorised
 Support for OAuth2 authorization code, client credentials and refresh token flows
 and more with more to come
  
I'm hoping the README has enough information about what you need to get started if you want to give it try. If something does go wrong submit an issue on github and i'll see about getting round to fix your problem! 
 Happy self-hosting!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I was thinking about hosting my own matrix server, which I don't have any experience with.
 However I was wondering how much control a server administrator has:
 -What can I see as server admin with E2EE. (Metadata I suppose, like who is texting who? Maybe IP adresses?)
 -Can I delete messages from the server? And does it get deleted for the Client then as well (I would assume so)?
 -Are there any scripts/plug-ins/extensions I can implement in the server? Like message self destruct timers for example.
 -Can I route the server through the Tor network (Like hosting it within Whonix) to hide server IP/Location?

 I'm just wondering if anyone here has created a backup MX with something like Docker-MailServer or anything similar?
 I know you can create another MailCow server and set it as a a relay which will then send the stored emails when the primary MX is back up and running but my aim is to utilise a free tier based server to capture any emails any time my home server is down.
 I know that emails will always be retried if they can't reach the primary server but I prefer to know that I have any sent emails somewhere I can see them rather than hoping they'll get resent.
 Does anyone know of any lightweight setup that I can deploy on a 1 Core, 1GB server?

I basically want something where I can store files and access through FTP or WebDAV... I need this as I want to attach this storage in file managers natively so I can open, create and manage files as if they were local. However for the next part I'm struggling to find a good solution. Photos I take on my phone I want to automatically sync to that location and I don't know how to best approach this.
 In my search I've across different software like seafile, syncthing and others, but they seem geared towards other uses or are too heavy for what I'm looking to do.
 Complete photo solutions with web-ui and other features aren't what I need either I think.
 Any and all advice and suggestions would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if it's worth upgrading looking at one specific dimension...port forwarding.
 Current Setup:
 I have a Netgear Nighthawk R8000P and it works totally fine (note that I can't use DD-WRT as it's only compatible with the R8000 not the R8000P). I have some small services running on rpi's through a reverse proxy which gets 80/443 (+ a VPN port) forwarded from the router. For what it's worth, I get ~600mbps up and down.
 None of my services are super intensive. I'm a 1 person household, no gaming, just standard web browsing, netflix, etc. The router is pretty full featured and has a dual-core 1.8GHz cpu and 512mb RAM.
 Question:
 Is it worth getting a MikroTik hEX S or Ubiquiti USG or EdgeRouter X (let's ignore which one for now, don't want this to be a Ubiquiti vs MikroTik convo) to replace the wired routing capabilities of the R8000P? Specifically looking at port forwarding?
 My main concern is being as secure as possible when opening ports (yes, as much as possible is through the VPN, but sometimes you just gotta port forward, ya know?). The logs show that the R8000P is doing a pretty good job fending off multiple DoS attacks a day. I'm pretty sure the answer is the R8000P is just fine and it's just seeing all your shiny Ubiquiti and MikroTik setups that's getting to me... :)
 Thoughts? Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title says it all. I currently have a Synology DS212J, which I bought in 2012 for £160. It’s equipped with 2x4TB RAID1.
 I think it’s the longest time I’ve owned a piece of hardware that has never failed - one original drive is still going too, with the other failing twice. Thank fluff for RAID1! However, the performance has also never been great. Slow network transfer feeds, slow interface, just all round slow.
 I’d like to be able to run some lightweight services on it such as Bitwarden / Vaultwarden docker and Apple Time machine, without it feeling like it’s going to keel over and die. Mainly though it’ll be a file server for my media app (Infuse on Apple TV). I’ll probably want to make it web accessible for file access too.
 So yeh, anyone got some recommendations or things to avoid? Maybe Synology performance Isn’t so bad now?

 I'm using Leantime as it looked amazing when I was looking for project management and it really is. The only downside is sometimes when editing to-dos, etc it will take ages to load or will just freeze. I am using Ubuntu 18.04 with apache2 and a varnish cache. The varnish cache helps speed up all sites but this site never seems to want to load fast. Ive seen others with Leantime loading slow but no solutions. 
 Does anyone have one?
 Thanks,

 I was looking a bit into my connection and I found out that the only IP that I can connect through the open internet and the only non-shared IP I have in my home is a IPv6 adress.
 That's all fine, issue is a lot of people still lack IPv6 compatibility and thus are unable to connect to anything I host if the lack an IPv6 adress, so I'm trying to find out it if is somehow possible to (ideally on the chap) make it possible for people only using a IPv4 adress to connect to me. 
 I'd love to hear your opinions as well as ideas, thanks. ❤

The Setup 
 VPS hosted at Hertzner acting as a proxy so that I have access to all the ports (25 & 80 and other ports) - Ubuntu 20.04
 VM at home running iRedmail - Ubuntu 20.04
 Wireguard connecting the 2 machines

 Port Forwarding

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been hosting Gitlab on a home server for years. I wrote my own script to update the DNS whenever my public IP changed at home (it was dynamic).
 This worked well, until I changed ISP, and my new ISP doesn't have IPv6 and blocks all incoming traffic (despite it being a "business" account).
 Now, I've been put on to reverse proxies, but I am not making heads-nor-tails on it, and seeking advice.
 I've tried Traefik, with limited success, and now looking into Caddy.
 I've also been looking into WireGuard (getting a handshake between client and server) and this was within a Docker container.
 What I'd like to have as a setup is my home server/Gitlab to tunnel into a docker container on a DigitalOcean droplet, so I can access Gitlab remotely (HTTP and SSH). Currently, I have to be local.
 My thinking is that I can dockerize the droplet, so I can run a public website(s) on it, as well as WireGuard in order to tunnel into servers at home (in this instance, Gitlab, but also looking into NextCloud).
 Any ideas?

 Long time lurker and learnt quite a bit. All a bit of a minefied with regards to my question.
 Anyways, bascially we have a sister company who are 30 miles aways from us and who are very very tight with their IT funding (well the MD is!) so i wanted to try and go down a self hosted route as i have a spare pi 3 and 4 at home or some old lenevo 4th gen i3s in work that i could add some storage to.
 They do 1 full weekly backup and 4 diffs every week using veritas to a qnap raid 1 box.
 I want to go down the route of having a cloud backup solution at my workplace as well and thought i would ask on here about a selfhosted solution first. They are on a 100MB dedicated line but are capped at 50MB (long story!) and we are on a 100 up and down. 
 I was after some advice on what your thoughts would be if i set up the pi or pc as a NAS using opennas or with some kind of nextcloud or other cloud software and create a full backup from our sister site to our site and also be able to do diff backups. I would probably have to use rsync for the diffs?
 I only asked here as i do believe it is a self hosted solution as i want to set it up in my workplace but it will also teach me something so that i can set that kind of solution up at home also.
 Erm, hope that makes sense as typed this up whilst fixing a problem over the phone and hey you know men can't multitask! Bah, thats just a myth!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 I'm looking to track the response time of a GraphQL query for an endpoint I hit. I can run the queries easy enough in Postman, or right in Grafana panel via the graphql data source plugin. What I want to do though is track the response time to display in a Grafana panel. 
 In Grafana, via the Graphql datasource plugin, I have many panels that are running queries to these endpoints. And in the 'query explorer' I can see the response time of each panel. I just want to track that and show it on a graph...
 Postman can do monitoring, and log the response time, but the free tier will only run the query every hour, which isn't frequent enough for me.
 I've tried Statping and PHPServerMon, but I can't get either of those to work with a GraphQL query.
 Any ideas? 
 Some open source hostable API monitor tool would be great. Or if someone knows a way to get the response time stats on a Grafana panel, stored, and into another panel, that'd be great too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi out there,
 since some years I'm running Proxmox on old HP DL 360 G7 servers. A while ago I bought (really cheap) Sun F20 Flash Controllers with 4x24 GB Flash on board. I'm using two of them for zfs special devices, which works good.
 Now I was thinking if I could use the secound pair of them as mirrored zfs device for /. Space should be sufficiant (24 GB is enough for Proxmox) and use a SD-Card for /boot, as the F20 is not bootable. The advantage would be to have two more "real" drives for data.
 Has anyone ever done this? I'm not really sure how to start. To create a zfs device on the flash controller is no problem, moving all data should be no problem, too, but how can I make the sd card bootable (just grub install?) and tell the system to boot from the flash/zfs instead of the hard disks?
 Is this all in all a clever idea or does it make things unnecessary complex?
 Best regards!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I'm looking for is a platform that has features from MSP, RMM and PSA platforms. It seems to be more and more common nowadays so I was hoping to be able to find a solution that would integrate all the necessary features/modules into a single portal to streamline things better.
 ​
 Hoping others in the community can help. I feel like I've been setting up lots of platforms and trials and wasting time to then come across something that falls short and is not negotiable. That being said I've tried to compile all that stuff I've come across on the various platforms into the following requirements that we need to be met. 
 ​
 We would prefer open-source self-hosted most but that isn't a deal breaker. SaaS is acceptable so long as we can meet these reqiurements.
 ​
 Our requirements do not need to be filled by the vanilla platform itself but we do want to have a single portal. So for example, if a platform doesn't support RMM features that we require, then we'd still be okay with that platform as long as it has an RMM integration to become a part of the portal too. Essentially transparently integrating with the platform's portal so that it's like the platform does have it anyways.
 ​
 Requirements
 -White-labeling
 -capable of custom domain with https for the customer-facing portal/helpdesk
 -capable of SMTP for email
 -Ticketing/helpdesk that can create tickets from emails received and send a standard auto-reply to the customer
 -RMM agent
 -Knowledgebase that allows us to make articles visible to all customers or only some.
 -CRM
 ​
 Other conveniences that'd be nice to have but if we had none of these but met all our requirements it'd still be acceptable
 -Appointments/Calendar
 -Invoices: print/email/etc, process payments
 -Asset management
 -Credential management
 -Attachments/storage: some way to distribute file(s) if needed to a specified customer
 -Chat
 -Project management: for staff
 -Leads
 -Custom fields on customers, tickets, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have the following very specific use case:
 I have a Yealink IP phone, which supports multiple contacts.
 I also have DECT phones, hooked up to my FRITZ!Box 7590. This FRITZ!Box 7590 supports pulling in a single CardDAV address book and pushing it to my DECT phones.
 My dad also has a Yealink IP phone.
 I would like to set up something where I can manage my DECT contacts, my IP phone contacts and my dad's IP phone contacts, exposing either two or three separate address books as CardDAV links. 
 I very specifically want to be able to add a single contact to multiple address books, or group them some other way so that they end up in separate address books, without having to add a contact multiple times. The reason for this is that we share a lot of business contacts and family contacts (for the IP phones), but the DECT phones do not require those same contacts. Eventually I plan on migrating them to a router that has DECT support as well, so at that point I would require a fourth address book with the contacts that are only relevant to my parents, which I would like to organize in a separate group, but still expose in their combined address book.
 It would be stupidly simple to grab a CardDAV library, set up a database with the contacts and a relation table to assign them to an address book, then when a specific address book is requested pull up all contacts linked to it. But for some reason, I can't find any tools that support this.
 I've tried using NextCloud, but that only allows sharing address books, and does not allow assigning a contact to multiple address books. If you share an address book with another user, that book's contacts are not included in the user's main address book. You cannot expose a Group as a CardDAV link, and you cannot even assign contacts to a Circle at all.
 Does anyone know of a tool that can help me out here? Given how simple it would be, I find it difficult to believe that it wouldn't exist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Nextcloud for cloud-hosting my files and taking advantage of object storage as the main storage feature so I don't need to allocate fixed storage capacity. However, when I try to play video files, the mp4 player of Nextcloud takes a significant amount of bandwidth and CPU resources, which is understandable since it needs to download a whole file from object storage via TCP/IP protocol.
 I've tried Seafile in my development environment, and I think it fits my need since it's faster than Nextcloud, and the built-in video player is significantly better than Nextcloud.
 But the drawback is Seafile does not support object storage as main storage so I can't scale up in terms of storage when using Seafile.
 I'm thinking of using external block storage, but I'm not sure what is the mount point for the block storage, is it at /opt/seafile/seafile-data? Any tips or gotchas when implementing this? And is there any better option?
 I'm not ditching Nextcloud entirely; just wanna separate video files from other files.

I was young and dumb (I am now 18). 
 Now, out of curiosity, I just went ahead and looked into those Drives and realized that I have a big photos-pile-mess. Scattered across these Drives are at least 15k photos/videos, many of them definitely d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Been looking for some wifi cameras that don't need the cloud. A lot I've seen have microSD cards for local storage, but still route all traffic to view the camera live stream / set it up over the internet.
 There seems to be a standard camera that gets rebranded as a number of different cameras that are all the same.
 I've seen a few PoE ones (Ubiquiti) - but slightly overkill for my needs - doesn't need to record. Just be able to open a live stream from the local network when needed.
 Thanks.

 Similar to NZBhydra2. Looks like it's made by the devs from the other 'arr' projects (e.g. radarr, sonarr, lidarr, etc). I've set it up and it's working. I figured I'd share it with you as I did a quick search and haven't seen anyone reference it yet.
 Anyways, linuxserver already has a docker image for it (which I am using). 
 Here are some useful links: * https://www.reddit.com/r/prowlarr/ * https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/prowlarr * https://wiki.servarr.com/prowlarr

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I was wondering if having both of these services on the same VPS would compromise security.
 More specifically, if Mailcow would require some looser settings (in order to allow sending/receiving mails) that would hinder Nextcloud's security.
 I know that we can have different Nginx configurations for each one of the subdomains ("cloud" and "mail"), but the server's open ports for example are common to both.
 Would it be safer to use 2 different VPS ? Or can we safely configure one VPS to handle both ?
 Thanks for your feedback.

 Ok, so I just access the server using my external IP (not 127.0.0.1 or 192.169.something.something) and the port number, right? Except it doesn't seem to work anywhere other than my own wifi (for example, on my phone I can use my external IP address to access my server, but if I turn the wifi off and reload from mobile data, it doesn't work anymore. Again, I am using my external address and of course my pc is on). It shouldn't be a router issue since I also use Jellyfin in the same way and it works. What could be the problem?

 Will update when it's restored. Sadly, any history/media that was uploaded there will not be recoverable, as I did not have any backups of the database anywhere. 
 I guess, take this as a lesson in proper backups for production environments le sigh.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been searching for this for a long time and all i can find are articles with "VPN is soooo much better than a proxy server" that are useless to me. 
 Anyway, i'm searching for a lightweight method to convert my paid VPNs to a proxy. I'm currently using multiple Virtualbox VMs with Win10, CCProxy server and OpenVPN client; i start the VM, connect to the desired VPN, run CCProxy and access the proxy server on 192.168.x.x. It works great, but it's extremely wasteful, especially when i run 10 VMs at the same time. Is there any (easy) method i could do that inside a LXC? My VPN provider supports L2TP/IPsec, IKEv1, IKEv2, OpenVPN and Wireguard; the proxy can be HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS 4, SOCKS 4a or SOCKS 5. 
 If anyone is curious why i would need that - a download manager i'm using (JDownloader2) supports just proxy servers and i figured why pay for premium filehost traffic if i can just use my existing VPN subscription to download 10 files in free mode at the same time.

I think its important we all run security scans in our home environments. I have tried Greenbone (source) but was not very impressed with it after attempting an upgrade and having it completely fail on me as well as windows scans not working at all even with the SMB package installed per greenbones own documentation. My requirements are that it needs to support windows and linux, and not be limited in terms of amount of IPs that can be scanned. Several friends and I have joined our networks together via IPSec to form the ultimate conglomerate lab space and we need a reliable solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a headphone amplifier with USB- and analoge inputs and a secondary device that can receive bluetooth audio and outputs it at line-level to the inputs of the amp. The source is usually my android tablet.
 However, the limited bandwith of bluetooth limits the achievable audio quality and range of movement of the source device. I imagine that WiFi would be a nice alternative, having both more bandwith and range.
 I would like to have a solution that allows me to output all audio from my tablet to a WiFi-device that can plug into my amp. Sort of a virtual speaker that just sends any input over WiFi to a receiver. Chromecast Audio seems to fit the bill but is no longer sold. There are some available on auction sites but I would like to have something that is still supported / in development.
 I am aware of partial solutions that allow specific apps to stream to a network device. Spotify and Tidal can do this. But its limited to these apps and not system wide.
 I imagine some project that I can install on a rasperry pi, connect my amp via USB / COAX and configure it as an audio device on my tablet. Does something like that exist?

 And I've seen that there are people who implement http basic auth for the cgit.
 What I'm wondering (haven't found it concretely), is if there is a way to set basic auth for some repos but make public others.
 The ssh access part is fine, gitolite should take care of it, but still I would like to allow my users to see their repos on the web client with no issues.
 Any ideas, probably protecting the routes with nginx or doing two runs of cgit for nginx, one for private, and another for public, but I would still like them to be on the same domain just reject http access.
 Any suggestions?

 I am sorry in advance, I have a rather basic questions but I can't really find an answer.
 I am running caddy and leantime in docker containers on the same internal network and with having port 9011 exposed for leantime. When I access it locally (local IP and port number) all works fine. If I try to access it through the reverse proxy, the site loads without any layout, only text. What am I missing?
 I started out with this one-liner which led to layout problems:
 <domain> {
 reverse_proxy leantime_app:80
 }
 ​
 Then I tried this, thinking it could by php, but leads to a blank site:
 <domain> {
 root * /var/www/html/public
 php_fastcgi * leantime_app:80
 file_server
 }
 I tried many variations but I believe I am quite close with one of the 2 versions above.

 Following a post today about EDMS it triggered an old obsession of mine. I was wondering if there is a secured EDMS. What I mean by secured is where documents would be decrypted on demand. I kinda not feel OK with having all of my important documents lying around unencrypted on my cloud server. Maybe this is stupid. But I was wondering if such EDMS existed, one that would decrypt my documents only when needed but would let them crypted the rest of the time.
 Or maybe, I need some kind of local EDMS that I run against my documents stored in a crypted volume only when I need it?
 What's your opinion on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all-
 Background
 I've been selfhosting internal services for a few years but I'm pretty new to public internet networking topics such as DNS hosting, DNS records, etc.
 I have purchased a domain to use for my internal/local domain. I know I can use .home or .local, but I wanted to use a domain to get proper lets encrypt certificates.
 I am following Tom Lawrence's video on using HAProxy, Acme, and lets encrypt to setup what is essentially an internal only reverse proxy. (Refer to: How To Create pfsense Let's Encrypt Wildcard Certificates using HAProxy) I would like to type in cookbook.domain.tld instead of something like 192.168.100.20:9000 to access a docker webUI. I won't be opening anything to the public internet, so this webUI will only be accessible on my own network.
 Problem
 I need to move the DNS hosting aspect of my domain away from Namecheap. Namecheap does not provide API access unless I own 20+ domains. I have read great things about both Cloudflare & DigitalOcean. I think I will stick with Cloudflare as it is free. DigitalOcean is free if you pay for one of their other services, but at this time I do not.
 Question
 I'm not sure how to move the DNS Hosting from namecheap to Cloudflare. I don't even really know if I'm using the correct terminology. Could someone point me in the direction of what terminology I should be googling to find a tutorial/write up on moving DNS Hosting from NameCheap to Cloudflare? Or provide a simple overview of the steps needed?
 Thanks

 Repo: https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma
 Uptime Kuma is basically similar to UptimeRobot.
 At first, I was looking for a monitoring tool which can watch my internal services. Though a lot of redditors here suggested statping here, unfortunately, it is not so stable in deep. I could not get downtime alert. I could not set the private channel for Telegram alert. The stats had gone wrong after restarted the statping docker.
 So I decided to build my own one.
 In this project, I fully used socket.io as the backend and Vue 3 as the frontend. You should feel the interactive is so quick compare to traditional web apps.
 It supports Docker or without Docker.
 I spent around 2 weeks to build this project. Hope you guys like it!
 Sorry for my bad English.🙉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I was looking for a tutorial on how to properly setup Pihole in combination with Lancache, without losing the full Pihole statistics and didn't found one, so I decided to share my solution with you.
 This is my first tutorial, so please be kind. Please let me know how I can improve the guide.
 Actually my initial idea worked, we just need to tell pihole that all requests which are served by Lancache should be redirected to it. Thankfully I was able to use a script provided by uklans to generate host entries that I can simply cat into pihole config. This is how I have done it without typing all the dns entries by hand:
 ssh to your pihole and execute the following commands:
 cd /home git clone https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains.git cd cache-domains/scripts nano config.json 
 Paste the following content into the file and replace YourLancacheIp with the actual IP:
 { "ips": { "generic": "YourLancacheIp" }, "cache_domains": { "default": "generic" } } 
 Now Ctrl+O to save the file and CTRL+X to close it. Now we let the script generate all the host files for us and insert them into pihole.
 sudo ./create-dnsmasq.sh cd output/dnsmasq cat * > /etc/pihole/custom.list 
 That's it! You can check if everything works by going into the pihole admin panel and look under Local DNS > DNS Records

 I self host quite a few services which I don't allow external access to. I wanted to try setting up my own VPN so I installed a Wireguard docker container and have it setup via a non proxied cloudflare subdomain.
 Both work as well as eachother practically. I'm curious to know the communities opinion on which is "better" aka more secure or better suited for a self hosted setup, is a OpenVPN via a router more secure than a software Wireguard solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Just to give some background, I've got a Debian VPS where I run a personal page just showcasing a blog and some small personal projects.
 On that same box, I have run a WordPress site on it as well and did all of the redirecting with the necessary DNS record stuff, and it works just fine (took a ton of tweaking since permissions are just stupid out of the box but yeah, it works).
 The problem that I've been dealing with is that I've been trying for AGES to run a second site on the same box with almost identical type settings on Nginx and I just get the white page of death, even after combing through permissions, etc for the newer page.
 At this point, I'm really just looking for something that hits these following points:
 - Some kind of Open Source alternative to something like Google Photos
 - Something that could display images in a nice art gallery format (this is because I would like to dump all my art onto a page, and just have users click a thumbnail to expand the image to the center)
 - Something that could be hosted on Nginx on a Debian based VPS
 ​
 I'd share my WordPress config for that second site (with a few portions modified for privacy, etc) but I don't think its worth it since this isn't a WordPress support page, and I've already tried to troubleshoot it to death.
 I just want something easy to host art images on Nginx.
 ​
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had been using Paperless for document management. It sucks in PDFs, OCRs them and then indexes them, so you can find anything with a quick search.
 https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless
 The developer stopped working on the project back in 2019. Even after he announced that the project was over, he maintained it for quite a while before he had to stop.
 The app was written in python 2, so there are certain challenges with porting it to python .
 Github says there are 527 forks. But that's a lot of forks to look through to see what's maintained.
 So, I am looking for an alternative document management system I can use for my scanned paperwork that can OCR it and index it.

 The question comes up from a small local community asking about a gig based app in the area and TaskRabbit doesn't cover my area.
 Thanks!

 This last month I've been setting up a little home server with Proxmox and a big HDD for media and documents. I have the backup of my Proxmox machines on this HDD, but now I'm trying to store a backup of the HDD on GCloud. I've managed to install GCloud on the Proxmox host (Ubuntu), and I can upload/download stuff, but I don't know how to do it to have it inside the Cryptomator vault, since it's not like in Windows that it looks like a folder/drive in the machine, but it's commands to upload everything.
 I've considered creating a ZIP with the contents, give it a password and just upload it, but I'm unsure if it's good enough. 
 What would be a good way to backup this drive while preserving privacy?

I've opened up ports 80 and 443 on my router for the Raspberry, used Namecheap Dynamic DNS service with a subdomain of a domain I own and generated a Let's Encrypt certificate for that subdomain.

 iRedmail, SOGo, Postfix, Spamassassin, ClamAV
 EC2 t3a.micro @ €5/m. €2 if I decide to pay upfront for 3 years
 SES @ free
 EFS for the mail, so unlimited resilient storage @~€0.02/GB. Easy to double up on mail servers too. You could mount S3 instead, and half that price.
 Route53 @ €0.3/m
 Managed patches
 LetsEncrypt Certs
 DNS all working
  
All hosted in Ireland. Now I can’t decide if I’m brave enough to move my email away from gmail! ActiveSync is so much nicer on the iPhone with the native apps than Gmail is.
 One gap - though the drives are encrypted, I’d like to figure out a way to encrypt the actual mailbox. Any suggestions welcome!

 EDIT: solved. Had to comment out the “php artisan migrate” out of the install script and run it after I restored the database. Also had to set the password for bookstack again for some reason and the password can be found on the .env file but that file won’t show up using ls because it’s hidden.

I would also consider alternatives that achieve the same result (something that scans my inbox (gmail/smtp)).
 The closest I've found is kanboard which has a bunch of outdated plugins that rely on a $ subscription to email endpoints like Mailgun/Postmark/Sendgrid.
 Thanks!
 Edit: I think I maybe can do this with n8n and Wekan but not sure!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I’ve been running my Synology DS920+ for about 6 months now and love it as a tinkering/home lab tool. That all being said it’s now running 15 or more docker containers for various things from all the **arrs, overseer, heimdall, yacht, portainer, home assistant, homebridge etc.
 I’d now like to step the game up a little by making it run smarter and faster, so this is going to be a two bit extended question. So bare with me…
  
Traefik vs Ngnix vs Caddy More than half the use of my NAS is Plex related (hence the **arrs), I’m really liking overseers GUI and integration into sonarr and radarr. I’d now like to put it to use and allow some of my PMS users to get their requests in from an external address of some sort (safest way possible without opening up the NAS to any attacks on open ports). I have heard varying things about Traefik and Ngnix until now and only Caddy as a result of finding this subreddit. What’s everyone’s personal preference and why? What’s easiest to get up and running? (Prefer systems with guis and easy to use)
 
Getting things running smoothly - this question is in relation to the number of docker self hosted apps growing and the available stock ram that is being used. In addition to this when I remember to check in on portainer I notice a large number of unused images/instances that take up space. So questions are, upgrades to ram? Automated pruning and/or combinations of both to keep things running smoothly into the future.
 
 Thanks for reading this far if you made it. Any help is greatly appreciated!

 Currently I use docker for all my containers, but I'm in the process learning Kubernetes, and I figure, "in for a penny, in for a pound". So I'm going to migrate all my containers to a k3 cluster, and figure it out as I go.
 But what I'd like to know is, what are people using for persistent storage? Especially where they are using Sonarr and the other Arr apps.. they all rely upon SQLite databases, and from experience, I know they don't work very well with NFS (The database always ends up corrupting.. it might take a few weeks, but it happens).

 plays the music on the server, not on the client
  able to cast music to multiple rooms in one way or the other (Airplay, snapcast, chromecast , whatever really)
  has a decent app to control it
  ideally available as a docker container
  
So far I’ve found Logitech Media Server, and some sort of combination of mpd and snapcast, but I really feel like I’ve been missing something obvious. Or is there just a bigger market for media servers that serve clients (like Jellyfin, Plex, Koel, ...) than there is for a server with playback?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current setup:
 OMV NAS with Samba shares hosting my movies, music, and TV shows. This NAS is serving media to a Raspi 4 with Dietpi hosting Plex and Airsonic (Media). I enjoy having my network very segmented, so I use one device for a few dedicated things.
 What I would essentially like to do is have my Media server serve audio to another Raspi connected to a stereo to have a media player (Streamer). This would be controlled by a tablet that can choose the music to be played.
 My questions are: 
  
If I put a player on that Streamer and have it running on a web server, what device will it play to when I access it in the browser on the tablet? Will it play on the tablet or on the headless Streamer?
 
Is Airsonic my best bet, or should I go with something else? 
 
If Airsonic is not the best, what can I put on my media server to serve music without having a dedicated OS?
 
 EDIT What I want is a tablet that anyone in the house can use to control various things (lights through Home Assistant, music, etc.) That tablet can control a Raspi streamer. That streamer is being served by a Raspi media server which is pulling music from a NAS. 
 I want every device to be dedicated (i.e. No other software on the NAS).
 I know that Rune and Volumio are highly recommended, but I don't want to either: * Have a different operating system on the media server, or * Have the streamer pull from the NAS directly (if I can help it).
 Ultimately, if I have to install a specific distro on the streamer, I can. I can use the Airsonic to serve music to my mobile device if I have to.
 EDIT 2 Cleaned up the post and clarified some points.

 Context: I am making a LAN only server with a few opensource web applications, no I have never coded with nodejs, first time creating servers, I am a newbie. I have managed to install iRedmail, since I didn't buy a domain name (don't need it, i use https://serverName:port/ from the other pc), I didn't use letsencrypt, instead self-signed certificates (openssl) are used. I have also installed Nextcloud, enabled self-signed, and tested its smtp mail, so yes the email server works fine, and I know which pork and domain name to use.
 I manually installed rocketchat on linuxmint (followed the manual installation on ubuntu). Rocketchat works fine on another port (not 3000), and I have managed to use nginx and enabled https with a self-signed certificates. So rocketchat itself works fine. Now the problem is with the smtp mail, iRedmail gives it a self-signed certificates. and the mailer throws a fit.
 I20210707-22:59:14.401(5) Exception in defer callback: Error: self signed certificate at TLSSocket.onConnectSecure (_tls_wrap.js:1501:34) at TLSSocket.emit (events.js:315:20) at TLSSocket.EventEmitter.emit (domain.js:483:12) at TLSSocket._finishInit (_tls_wrap.js:936:8) at TLSWrap.ssl.onhandshakedone (_tls_wrap.js:710:12) at TLSWrap.callbackTrampoline (internal/async_hooks.js:120:14) { code: 'ESOCKET', command: 'CONN' }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm looking for a (free) self-hosted EDMS (electronic document management system) to replace my current system of a folder of PDFs and adobe acrobat folder search. The issue I'm having is that I really like adobe acrobat's folder search functionality and I'm struggling to find something that can replicated it, in particular I am looking for:
  
When searching for a term, if it is in multiple times in the same document, to be shown all of the times.
 To be able to view and download the PDF having found the document.
  
I don't need any other features (other than batch uploading). The best ones I've found so far are Ambar, I, librarian, and Lodestone with their multiple 'snippet' search functionality, however for various reasons they won't work with my use case.[1]
 Does anyone have any other suggestions? Thank you!
  
[1]: Ambar is amazing, but it is obviously designed for images and I have yet to find a quick way of exporting PDFs from it. I, Librarian search snippet feature is only available with the paid version which isn't feasible for me at the moment. Lodestone looks like it would work, but it isn't ready for production yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 Most of my communications is done via email. In fact in all my contracts its stated as the primary method of contact and communication. Everything goes through the email ticket system.
 In theory.
 In practise, it can be useful in some situations to be a bit more instant-messagey. 
 However, I know to my cost that as soon as a user gets a direct contact option then will immediately use it for absolutely everything no matter how unimportant or stupid. All rational thought goes out the window and everything immediately becomes a private message. As soon as they can sidestep the email/ticket system - they will do so. everytime. day or night. For this reason I can never use anything that reveals any phone number or direct email address, nor anything that allows initiation of contact from the client side.
 I want something that can do the following:
  
Mobile app for iOS and Android. Not a web page. (but a web-app is ok, as long as it looks like a real app. and has its own icon)
 If I need to - then i initiate a conversation at my side, probably in a web browser.
 I Send user a QR code by email. User scans QR with the mobile app. Instant one-on-one communication commences.
 Single click ability to add photos, images, short videos, voice notes in the mobile app. as simple as signal whatsapp etc.
 at end of conversation, easy method of zipping the whole conversation including media up into one single file and adding it to a ticket
 conversation not stored long term on the messaging server (only just long enough to create the aforementioned zip)
 QR codes are single use only. User has no method of initiating conversation from their side without one.
  
Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’m a newbie to self hosting with limited linux experience but I like to tinker. 
 I bought myself an Rpi4 and followed a YouTube guide on how to install basic web apps like OMV, Docker, Portainer, NPM and PiHole. 
 While doing the above I found out that my ISP is under CGNAT and I couldn’t even access some of router configs to port forward. 
 I found some tutorials (link below) to bypass this by creating a VPN tunnel to a VPS. I setup WireGuard accordingly on the Pi, bought a domain name and rented out a VPS on OVH. I also setup the domain on cloudflare as dns only
 The connection between the client(rpi4) and the host (VPS) is working out well tested thru ping but I still can’t access my web apps on the domain. 
 I have been researching and testing out other tutorials for the matter for the past few weeks and I haven’t found an answer yet. I even had to reset the VPS and RPI4 bcoz I was experimenting with ufw firewall settings and I tried installing NPM on the VPS itself. 
 Could anyone point me to the direction of what I need to learn in order to troubleshoot and fix this issue or if possible a probable solution?
 Thank you!
 This was the tutorial for setting up the WireGuard vpn

 I was wondering if any of you know a panel like CapRover, but with a few additions. I would like to have some sort of Ressourcen limits, and user accounts. And API integration (a way for my WHMCS to create customer accounts) would be nice, but I just need an API, I can code the integration myself.
 I'm interested in both - docker and one-click VPS panels for one-click Apps to sell as an addition to shared hosting.
 Example: CapRover (for Docker), Ploi-Core (too expensive) (for one-click Apps im VPS)...
 Thanks for reading this. Have a good day :D

 I'm an Appwrite maintainer and we're really happy to present a brand new Appwrite release with lot's of amazing features, bringing us one step closer to being the best Firebase alternative.
 Appwrite is extremely easy to self host and a single docker command is all it takes!
 docker run -it --rm \ --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ --volume "$(pwd)"/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \ --entrypoint="install" \ appwrite/appwrite:0.9.0 
 TLDR; → Appwrite on Github
 With Appwrite 0.9 we've squashed some bugs 🐛 , broke some APIs, and got you some amazing new features!
 ☑️ We've added platform wide Android Support
 ☑️ A shiny new Kotlin Server SDK
 ☑️ Flutter Desktop Support
 ☑️ 6 New Cloud Function Runtimes!
 ☑️ Faster Cloud Function Executions 🏃
 ☑️ A revamped Sessions and Storage UI to give you more information on the dashboard
 And lots more!
 Appwrite also has support for ARM devices and you can run Appwrite even on a Raspberry Pi!
 All these features are a result of the amazing community feedback from Reddit and Github alike and as with everything we do, we love to work together with our community of 250+ code contributors when we implement these features.
 We'd love you to play around with Appwrite and share your valuable feedback and together 💪, we can make it better.

 I'm on a Raspberry Pi 4 and have built the docker image for the synapse server (v1.37.1) from source. The Rapsberry Pi is somewhere on my network, and access to the docker image is managed by nginx on another server. 
 I can access the synapse server using Element (previously known as Riot). I can log in using either an account generated by the command line, either by making a new one from the interface after having it enabled in the homeserver.yaml file. In the logs, I can see me logging in on these account, independent on whether I'm doing this on the android app, on using Firefox. 
 However: no matter which user I use to log in (command-line made or made via the register button): I cannot see any other user. When entering the name in the "new chat", I simply get "No results". N…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you know an inbound email service in a self-hosted server to receive email messages from other email servers (via SMTP I guess?), then POSTs the messages to an https endpoint, and then delete the message. I don't need to send email with that server.
 I have seen some self-hosted emails services (like Postal) but they are a bit on the overkill territory, as they are a fully-fledged email server.

 What are your thoughts? How do you manage your selfhosted services through docker? Or do you not use docker at all, if not what do you use?

 Does anything like this exist? Azuracast looks like it expects a clean/dedicated server. Bottle Radio looks like it plays music off of Spotify, which doesn't have the podcast (and won't, for reasons). LibreTime looks like it needs time slots, whereas I want to just keep running this.

 My end goal is to have a Dokuwiki server available for myself, a few friends and family. I've been messing around with Dokuwiki on a local computer that I use as a server: I followed a guide, installed XAMPP, did some port forwarding, and I can now access my Dokuwiki outside of my local network. Successful test! (and promptly turned off XAMPP).
 But, online, I've seen people indicate that XAMPP shouldn't be used for live websites. Whenever someone asks about security the usual answer is: "you should only be using it for local building/ testing, and if you are using it that way then there is no security risk". 
 But what are the security risks of using XAMPP for running a website/ Dokuwiki? Is there anything I can do to secure XAMPP? Is there a better way that isn't too complicated?
 Thank you for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I asked a similar question months ago but (for some reason I can't remember) I didn't end up liking Dotclear which was the only suggestion.
 I write a lot of blog content for fun. I currently blog on Medium just because it's super easy and fast.
 However, I have a whole network of domains and - because I generally try to self-host vs. use SaaS whenever possible - would much rather deploy something that I manage and control.
 Ghost.org seems to be a recurrent recommendation for a self-hostable platform that mirrors Medium's functionality (lightweight UI, fast). However I believe the last time I checked it was only suitable for deployment on a VPS and couldn't run on basic shared hosting w/o root permissions.
 Whenever I've used Wordpress, I end up paring down a lot of functionality from themes to get something that's as lightweight and fast as possible. I need some CMS that makes it easy to create text with the odd image -- and perhaps to also embed YouTube videos. But no functionality beyond that. 
 Is there anything that could fit the bill for me? Obviously there's Wordpress but the whole reason I'm not posting using it right now is that I find it bloated and slow compared to Medium.
 Thanks for any suggestions!

apple homekit - siri
 amazon alexa
 google assistant
  
we'd like to self host the camera system and I'm strongly considering Shinobi since it works natively on linux and is well recommended. We want to avoid cameras that talk to the cloud or require a subscription fee. Also we're looking for indoor cams and outdoor cams and doorbell recommendations.
 ideally we'd want to say things like the following and it should just work after all is setup
  
"alexa show me the garage camera"
 "alexa show me the basement camera"
 "alexa show me the doorbell"
  
support we'd like from cameras
  
ONVIF Profile S
 PoE
 works with smart assistants - can view camera stream on the assistant display
 can be selfhosted - no subscription fee
 view camera streams when not at home network. In laws are not very tech savy I could setup wireguard vpn for them, but if there's a way to access the camera streams without needing to vpn in, that would be great
 (optional) notifications from camera events
 (optional) camera recognizes people
  
what are some of your camera recommendations?
 does anyone have experience or a similar setup that you could share?

Plus the knowledge repository, i.e. the library, plus the inventory (we keep track of everything we own, their manuals, and their warranty expiration dates)... 
 I've begun fiddling with self-hosted Django-based CMS, but the handling between Windows and the Linux distro I'm using (MX) is giving me a few headaches. How do I ensure stability?
 In fact, is there a way of doing a distributed hosting that takes advantage of all of our machines and redundantly stores the data so that, if any machine's memory gets damaged or wiped or ransomed or whatever, or if the central server fails because we're all travelling and there's no one to maintain it, there's always at least two reasonably recent copies floating around, ready to be rescued?

 This would provide easier email backups, treatment of data, "unlimited" storage -amongst many other advantages- while also not having to deal with reputation and emails going to spam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone.
 I would like to have my own something like nicerepely or SimpleSat. I kind of have an idea... I just don't know how to start.
 Basically, if one of my workers help someone and that help is concluded, that worker, "worker jones" will send an email to "customer skinny Pete". That email should contain a "please rate my service" thing that has maybe 3 to 5 smileys ranging from very happy to very sad. So If "customer skinny Pete" get's an email from worker.jones@mycompany.com, clicks on the very happy smiley, a browser link opens up and then it tells "customer skinny Pete" something like, thank you very much please add some feedback or what not or simply close the page. That's all "customer skinny Pete" needs to do.
 On my end, I should see something like who the customer was/or maybe it can be anonymous I don't know yet, but what im more interested in seeing is how many smileys, and the happiness of the smileys "worker jones" gets. This will maybe translate to happiness bonuses for "worker jones" and maybe "worker Karen" will stfu and do her job better?
 I hope I make sense...
 I suppose I could use WordPress for the website stuff? Or would something else be better for this? SimpleSat is more in line with what I would prefer... but at $79 dollars per month... that's allot of money for us south Africans...
 Your help / suggestions would sure be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My parents store all our family photos and important documents on an external hard drive. I keep telling them it's a ticking time bomb and ask them to bring it from time to time to dump it to my server which in turn has a backup.
 However, I want to host something to enable them to upload their new data to my server directly. I tried setting up ownCloud, Nextcloud and most recently SeaFile. I'm very impressed by the latter in particular but none of them sync actual directories. They let users upload data but the data is stored in hash tree structures like `54b15188-65bc-4b02-b47d-e52f39aa6b6f/b8/8ab96740ef53249b9d21fb3fa28050842266ba`.
 I want them to be able to sync a directory from their PC, `Christmas 2021` containing a bunch of `IMG_???.jpeg` and I want it to end up on my server in the exact same way it left their PC with the same `Christmas 2021` directory and the files within. I can't ask them to rsync and I hate the thought of their hard drive dying. Is there a simple tool for this?

 Is there a way to scan directly to a local folder, or a folder on a NAS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 Wondering if there are any PHP / Laravel / web developers or experts who might have a few spare cycles. I had some UI and usability improvements I'd like to try to propose for a fork / branch of BookStack ( https://www.bookstackapp.com/ ). I don't know if these ideas are really just front-end changes or if they require some alteration of how data is stored in the MySQL database.
 Idea:
  
More like a collapsible tree / "folder" view of "notebooks" (what is currently called a Book) and support infinite depth of 'pages'. If you've ever used Onenote or clones, basically that type of organization. 
 
Remove UI clutter on "home page" and just get a tree list of the "notebooks" (collapsible) with the leaf page(s). I remember one of the views of Bookstack can do this but I don't think you can make it look like that on login and I remember this view still had some unwanted UI clutter (on the top-left?).
 
 If you're curious, I did propose these changes to the creator (Dan , who sometimes comments on these posts) but he's pretty happy with Shelves / Books / Chapters / Pages paradigm while I and my friends / family / colleagues didn't find that metaphor translated very well real world usage. I found myself having to explain the Bookstack's nomenclature many times while people were quickly productive with Onenote or Confluence (aside from the UI awkwardness surrounding Spaces).
 I respect that Bookstack is generously open-source and the author has created it primarily to serve his needs.
 Note: I'm an electronics engineer / embedded programmer / FPGA person by degrees and work experience but have become proficient and reasonable capable in doing lightweight DevOps / self-hosting. Not a PHP or "front-end" expert but happy to do what I can to help/contribute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I install kubernetes (or rather k3s and/or rancher) on a singular node (I rent one remote server), does it actually provide me with any practically useful benefits?
 My current setup is using Docker compose and I have different folders with their own yaml files for groups of services (e.g 01-reverseproxy and 02-nextcloud). Starting them all up can be annoying and I ended up writing my own bash script to recurse through the folders and run Docker compose up on the yaml files, but that's clunky. 
 It also becomes difficult to actually manage or troubleshoot any of the services because I have to cd to the directory first to then type cumbersome docker-compose commands. Although Portainer may help with that, I haven't installed it or used it yet.
 How my secrets are currently stored with the docker compose setup is also a mess, some of them are directly in the compose files, most of them are in a .env file but both ways suck in my opinion.
 I've read that kubernetes has better secret management and coupled with rancher I have a fully featured web management panel. I believe the rancher web UI even has terminal emulator too?
 Is the kubernetes secret management worth it for a single node cluster? Are there any other kubernetes features that I may find helpful?
 At a higher level about orchestration: if I add two or more nodes to a kubernetes cluster, does it only make sense if those nodes are able to communicate with very low latency? (I.e multiple raspberry pies in my house or multiple servers in the same data center)?
 If I were to sign up for the Oracle free forever VM, would it make sense to add it as another node in my kubernetes cluster? Even though it's likely to be in a different state from my main server?
 Thanks in advance for your helpful responses and humoring my ramble-ey question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, i'm a long time lurker, and i'm currently finishing setting up my yunhost server.
 Yunohost is amazing for noobz like me, the only problem is the rather lackluster SSO.
 No 2fa, and for the admin console you don't even input a username. 
 That combined with my desire to keep as many ports closed on my home router/modem combo, brought me to installing tailscale.
 And that works amazingly! Thing is, I don't quite understand how to disable regular access to my server over regular internet.
 I tried closing all of the ports, but than I cant generate new ssl certificates for my subdomains (which may not be needed if I plan to have my users access through vpn only, but I hate the annoying popup message browsers give.)
 So how (or where) can I configure my server to allow access ONLY through tailscale? 
 Thank you all in advance, and additional thanks for having this amazing place and community for starting self-hosters!
 P.S Is installing keyclok and heimdall and disabling the yunohost dashboard a good idea? I feel like at that point it'd be better for me to just migrate to a debian/docker set up. I dunno.
 Edit: spelling

I did this previously in Packet Tracer (PT) and the mail server was fine there, I know PT is only simulator I want to do a mail server that's similar to that in PT but on eve-ng.

Photos are backed up from my iPhone (and any other cameras) via Resilio Sync to a machine running PhotoStructure. 
 PhotoStructure copies my photos into my library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe this is a better one for a web development sub, but a few weeks ago someone posted about self-hosted documentation software (https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/o15u2f/selfhosted_documentation/). There were many good suggestions like Bookstack and WikiJS but the ones I looked at are all this .yml files or docker stuff, which goes way over my head.
 Maybe I should look in to Docker and stuff as it would open up a lot more options overall but meh.
 Are there any alternatives that can be hosted on a typical Linux web server with cPanel, like Wordpress? Upload the PHP script or similar, set up a MySQL database, and then go to the live directory and use it kind of thing? I already have the server so may as well use it!
 Thanks

I have a handful of domains with namecheap and found that the MX records on one of my domains had been changed without my knowledge. I've fixed it now, but it is still worrying as I am supposed to be the only one with access to my account. Namecheap support has been very unhelpful. 
 Strangely something similar happened at GoDaddy a few years ago. Some of my A records mysteriously changed - that's why I left GoDaddy for Namecheap in the first place. To be fair I didn't have 2FA enabled, but it is turned on now. I've also changed to a much stronger password. 
 Still, does such a tool exist? Something like this dnsspy - but self hosted
 Otherwise, has anyone else experienced something like this before? (DNS records changing by themselves)

 It has to be easy to install, not need lot of resources, and easy to use (mainly, it has to do http GET or ftp/smb "ping"). No agents on the machines, but I dont think they are needed for this easy work.
 No have now any other requirements... what should I look for? Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have setup a restic repo on my Onedrive and am using the in-built Rclone backend to upload the snapshot to my Onedrive repo.
 I am finding that each snapshot is uploading in full size to Onedrive but once complete the repo is only marginally larger (I.e. base snapshot + incremental change). Should restic be doing this? My residential internet connection is running full steam uploading 20+ GB to Onedrive and it takes 24hr+.
 Is this because restic doesn't create snapshot files 'incrementally' I.e. base + snap 1 + snap 2 + snap 3 and restic then only uploads the newest snapshot (snap 3)?
 Is there a better way to run the above backup process? I am already creating a local snapshot, but I was wanting a second cloud-based backup.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Selfhosters!
 A while back I posted here that I was working on Keila, an AGPLv3-licensed alternative to Mailchimp & Co - And I received a lot of really helpful feedback from you all :-)
 One of the things that many of you pointed out was: 1) A WYSIWYG editor is absolutely essential, 2) Open/click tracking is non-negotiable.
 So I’m happy to report: Keila now has a WYSIWYG editor (with full Markdown support still in place) and open/click tracking.
 I think Keila is now ready for some real-world action. So I’d be very curious to hear what you think of it, if you encounter any bugs, or what features you think are still missing.
 Here are some of the new features that I added since I last posted here:
  
WYSIWYG editor
 Click/open tracking
 Visual Template editor
 Template fully tested in Outlook, MS Mail, all other major clients
 Campaign scheduling
 Improved dark theme (and still no light theme)
  
It’s now also much easier to install Keila since it now has automatic database migrations in place.
 Some features that are still planned for v1.0:
  
Contact quality monitoring & bounce handling
 Custom contact fields + segmentation
 Image/attachment uploads
 Contact syncing API/Webhooks
 Drip-style email automations
  
You can find more information about the project on keila.io or on GitHub.
 If you want to give Keila a try without installing it yourself, you can check out the hosted version of Keila here.
 For installing it on your own server, take a look at the installation guide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Two Questions:
 Q1.So I've been trying to setup an LDAP server by using Apache Directory Studio to setup users via the GUI in an Ubuntu VM which has been going pretty well so far.
 The problems I've been having is trying to figure out how to connect a VM's LDAP server to an external app for usage.
 It seems like you need to pay for an actual domain name (example.com) and setup a fully fledged A record to do the proper handoffs.
 Is it even possible to utilize the localhost of an Ubuntu VM to then utilize it in an external app somewhere else?
 Q2. What are some self-hosted applications for using an actual LDAP setup?
 I was thinking of possibly setting up an LDAP instance on a server machine in my lab, and then dictating it somehow that if any computer that connects is registered as a machine on the network, then I could automount the drives of that server.
 Would this be a good example of using LDAP in a selfhosted lab?
 What are some examples that you guys have deployed for LDAP?
 ​
 Thanks!

I don't want browser history, or tabs, or notes, just bookmarks, from my computers or my cellphone, in one place, two profiles. Hell, if there is nothing self-hosted, and there is a great cloud setup that cost a few bucks, I'm willing to pay it, as I manage thousands of bookmarks between topics on network engineering, and development in several languages, and it could be that "one site you saved a year ago that had that snippet you need" that saves the day.

 I setup a wireguard server and successfully configured it on my android phone.
 In the client config file I put my Unifi dream machine as the DNS entry. The dream machine only has the IP address of my AdGuard home instance as the DNS for the network. This blocks ads for all devices on my home network. This doesn't block ads on the device using wireguard though...
 I changed the DNS entry in the wireguard client config to the IP of AdGuard home and it blocks ads. I know I can just keep it this way but I'm Just wondering if anyone could explain why that is? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[people seemed to like the web-based thunderbird setup i posted recently (https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ocergi/i_integrated_thunderbird_into_nextcloud_for_some/). i've got it down to a single image you can run to get straight to fresh, working thunderbird in a browser at localhost:3000.
 https://hub.docker.com/r/kebles/wanderbird
 i'm an extreme beginner with docker so i'm sure there's issues but for what it is it's nifty. i tested it on a few local pcs, a 4gb ram dual core vps, and it works! i would avoid exposing it to the internet long term tho though, my instance is individually reverse proxy'd through nginx through caprover so all ssl and stuff.
 if anyone feels like giving it a shot and giving ideas and feedback, hit me! 
 docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /config:/home/kebles/mail/ -d kebles/wanderbird
 it allows you to select your mod key at startup, to control your thunderbird window if you open others. if you use a tiling wm, use a key opposite to your mod key.
 home is /config - map volume to a folder of your choice
 /config/.config/i3/config - i3 config file
 /config/.thunderbird - tb profile 
 what i plan to add is communication with the local notification daemon for emails. if i'm ambitious maybe building a stack that hosts this and a carddav/caldav server. anyway. just an experiment. let me know if you like! 
 for clipboard transfer between the container and host, there's a small black arrow halfway down the left hand side of your window that you can transfer clipboard data to and fro with.
 a thunderbird addon i recommend is the "restart button" and "minimize instead of close". obvious reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im running an RPi 3b+ w/ 4TB SSD because its what I have on hand and didnt want to unnecessarily spend money. It runs docker containers of a web server, portainer, xmpp server, and reverse proxy. 
 I want to expand my self-hosted setup to rid the last few cloud-based services I use:
  
Photo gallery to sync with devices
 Calendar and contacts to sync with devices
 Notes to sync with devices
 Fileshare/backup to prevent dataloss
 Mail server
 Maybe swap over from XMPP to Matrix after some more security research
  
I gave the thought of upgrading to a Rpi 4 with 8GB of RAM, but with the case, power adapter, and the other accessories necessary to run/hold multiple drives for a RAID it seems just as expensive and less powerful. I don't plan in the near future to need extensive transcoding like Plex (maybe in a year or more). I have a server rack for my networking devices with extra space, but im in close quarters so I try to avoid excessively loud units.
 So what are your recommendations? What software should I use to fulfill my needs? Do I get an Rpi4 and some accessories or do you have something better to recommend? Should I start collecting/shucking 3.5 drives or start slow with more SSDs?
  
TLDR: Upgrade from Rpi3B+. Server or RPi4 w/ 8GB? Lightweight service recommendations? SSDs vs 3.5 HDDs?

 Then, I thought I could ask you directly what are your recommendations for a streaming application that would meet some criteria : - Can be deployed on docker (or on synology directly) - Suited for large collections of songs - Has an android app to stream on phone - Can play to mulpile dlna devices at home at the same time (ds audio offers it by selecting multiple devices at the same time, but it gets buggy and I often need to restart server)
 Any suggestions of something that would meet those criterias? I tried plex, as I'm using it for my series, but it doesn't support multiple dlna at the same time.
 Thank you in advance for your help :)

Synology feels like a reliable appliance - it's going to update OK, going to no lose my data without a good reason, and going to not need tweaked all of a sudden.
 I finally got a server rack for Christmas, and I have a relative who could really use a NAS, so upgrading to a rackmount unit makes sense.

 My NAS' motherboard is an Asrock j4105-itx. I can use wake on LAN to power up the NAS, that's great. But if the NAS has been sent to suspend, the magic packet won't power up the NAS.
 I'm thinking that a workaround could be to use hibernate instead of suspend, the rare times I need to make sure the NAS is all quiet.
 But is my problem a common thing among people who use WOL?

 Now I've made the jump to Ubuntu server (I'm a Linux novice) and installed all my favorites containers there.
 Most of them are with bind mounts, but I was forced to make a docker volume for a Postgres database.
 I've read that volumes are the recommended way to store persistent data.
 Can you guys help me understand and answer the following, please?
  
Should I only work with volumes and not bind mounts?
 How do I easily and automatically take a backup of my container data (preferably to my NAS)?
 Is it something like https://hub.docker.com/p/loomchild/volume-backup or https://hub.docker.com/r/futurice/docker-volume-backup? Can you recommend something else?
 How do you edit various files in the volumes, when the data is located in /var/lib/docker/volumes/, and you have to sudo all the time? I would prefer to have the folder mounted in something like Visual Studio Code, but I don't have access with my user (without sudo).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I recently setup heimdall. And decided to as I do with all my other sites set it to go thru my nginx reverse proxy. But there is a weird thing, when I try to visit it it gives me an items and apps button and a login button. But these all redirect to http://127.0.0.1:8888(Port of heimdall).
 Do you guys have any idears what could cause this as this only happens when it's being directed thru my reverse proxy. As when I just go straight to the IP from my PC it works.
 (My setup)Heimdall port 8888 set to 80 on the container port.Nginx reverse proxy with the below settings.
 server {
 listen 80;
 server_name subdomain.domain.xyz;
 ​
 location / {
 proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
 }
 }
 And it gives the below problem

 ​
 Edit: I was able to fix it by switching from NGINX to Caddy which i had wanted to do for a long time so win win I guess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 I have been working for a while on a side project I call Photostore. Photostore is a self-hosted mobile photo/video backup solution. Kind of like a really boiled down version of Google Photos (without machine learning or any public cloud connectivity). There are two parts to the app:
  
The frontend - written in Flutter which compiles to iOS, Android and Web. 
 The backend - a Python/FastAPI API server app that can be configured with a Postgres or SQLite DB. (Dockerfile provided in the project)
  
So far the Photostore app has the ability to: 
  
Backup mobile photos and view mobile photos for multiple devices (each device is identified by a custom identifier defined per device)
 Mobile videos can be backed up as well, but can not currently be played through the app

 Since I’m often far from home (where this server is) I would like it to turn on automatically (or remotely) when electricity is back, so that I won’t need always someone to do it physically. 
 Any idea on how to achieve this? How did you solved this problem with your servers?

 Just posted the first rev of wireguard-initramfs for debian bullseye.
 This enables you to setup a wireguard network during kernel init, enabling remote crypt FS unlocking via dropbear over wireguard, removing the need to expose ports or services on the remote network; additionally this enables you to create a remote box that is fully encrypted with no local key material outside of the boot wireguard client private key.
 Hope someone else finds this useful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to build a homeNAS. I've been using synology but I wasn't too happy and I think I'll roll my own. So far I can achieve the following:
  
I am leaning towards Arch Linux (have used Ubuntu, Void, Artix but liked Arch based in terms of lightweightedness and customizability).
 
I can install root on ZFS and add other storages on ZFS. I can manually set up snapshot cycles using sanoid.
 
whatever complicated software I want to run, I run in docker if possible.
 
I have tried TrueNAS Scale, and 21.06 beta isn't quite ready yet.
 
 I, however, am not going to dig around in CLI and config file all day long. I have a few things I'd prefer to have some "service" running on web GUI if possible.
 Things are: 4. Web-based file manager. I use TinyFileManager or FileRun 5. docker management. I use portainer. 6. server health monitoring. i can use cockpit.
 Things I'm looking for:
 A. I really would like to ask for advice for a KVM-QEMU web-based admin, kinda like virt-manager, but run totally on the web interface with display on web-VNC--like what TrueNAS Scale or Synology DSM offers. I'm looking at this list from KVM site and would appreciate any pointers.
 B. Web GUI to manage my scheduled snapshots (commanding sanoid basically).
 I'd appreciate any recommendation for solving A & B above.
 Thanks a lot for any advice in advance! Cheers!

 The main problem that I'm facing right now is that my ISP does not support port forwarding.
 Questions:
  
Will using a VPN on my machine help me enable remote connections? 
 If so, which VPN should I consider for free(at least initially) use? 
 Would it cause any issues if I later switch to reverse proxy (for adding Nextcloud)?
 
 I also read somewhere that I can use an ec2 instance to route my traffic through ssh. Is this possible? Any drawbacks, experiences?
  
If VPN, ec2 traffic routing is not the solution to this, is there an alternative?
 [Sorry for the newbie questions, couldn't find many articles on it]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently i am using matrix. But recently i found out that the protocol leaks a lot of metadata and most of it ends up at matrix.org and vector.im . This concerns me and i don't think i will be using matrix until this is solved.
 Other alternatives are XMPP but i hate the fact that the clients seems so incompatible with each other. I know of snikket but i don't like the fact that it runs in docker(but i would use it if i have to) and they don't have a desktop client yet. There is also signal, but they are turning a bit shady these days when they hid commits for a year. And also despite being open source, to self host signal is extremely hard, which i don't like. And also the crypto currency stuff surrounding signal.
 The only other alternative i know of is a fork of matrix(called Grid) that is currently only a protocol specification.
 What else can i use?

 Often I'm on slow local hotel/countryside wifi connection so I can't benefit from the fast server-side internet link, being limited by the local speed.
 Is it possible to set up some type of MITM compression on the server (like Opera or Google do/used to to) where pages are compressed on the server before being sent to the client?
 Problem I see is that with webpages being https, the server can't downscale images etc that take up the most bandwidth.
 Any ideas? Or just not possible?

 It's going to be used by my parents and some other older family members so the more it works like what they know (in this case MS Word) the better. I would like to avoid getting calls about "asterisks appearing when I make something bold" if possible
 Should be selfhosted and preferably it should save the files on the server but I can work around this point if need be.

 Is there an alternative that would allow me to have 2-3 clients to two-way sync files from a subset of the folders in the main server? Preferably a low-configuration alternative, where a short config file can specify the server IP and which folders I want to sync and where to store them in the client. Handling file history for some folders (server configuration) is a nice bonus.
 If this is possible with syncthing can someone point me to some good resources?
 Thanks in advance!
 ETA: FOSS is preferred :)

 My husband and I are big fans of those old SingStar games for PS2, and I was wondering if anyone has anything similar that we can selfhost? We like being able to have the lyrics scroll, and a gamification aspect like rating vocal input to a microphone would be awesome! :P
 Thank you so much! :)

 any questions or feedback feel free to ask, i figured if i'm competent enough to understand what's going on others probably will too but i'm sure i'm awful at explaining bits, but i want to learn how to FOSS in this manner more anyway. 
 my instance is hosted from a shitty old laptop running ubuntu 4c/4t, with data off a usb3 ssd, it's plenty fast even over wan. 
 hope this gives someone more fun ideas!

I tried to search for people using IMDbpy but couldn't find anything for tracking specific titles/actors. Mostly people use full IMDb data sets and API for pulling either all info, or for "I have watched this" lists.
 Would love to one day find something that'll be able to send a notification:
 -Keanu Reeves got added to Matrix 5
 -Matrix 5 release date set for xx/xx/xx
 I think the official app allows you to follow and get the notifications, but would like to not rely on Amazon's app for this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've decided to start chasing my old dream of having all my data "in the cloud" and accessed uniformly across my devices but without relying on infrastructure that is not in my control.
 Today I have some of it on a dedicated server running a Pydio instance, I have been pondering moving 100% of my data there (documents and media) but that got me thinking about the current pain points:
  
Pydio: Pydio is reliable but functionality is not great and I don't like the mobile app.
 Backup: My backups are handled by custom scripts that I am not fully happy with and are a pain to restore.
 Availability: I am dependent on that one server being up. If there is any issue with it, I am screwed out of my files.
  
I would like to get a second server that can remain up while the other one is down. Ultimately, I would like it to be able to scale so that I have a third server at home, and not have to change anything to the infrastrucure.
 So in essence, I am asking for a scalable distributed filesystem that would handle replication transparently across the nodes and abstract the storage so that I can either access it in an unique way from various cloud storage server instances (e.g. NextCloud) or by mounting it directly from my client home machines.
 Right now I am looking at object storage like OpenIO, CEPH or MinIO, however I get the feeling that they are intended for high performance servers and what I have may not cut it, especially with regards to network latency.
 I don't need high performance when writing, but I would like to be able to stream video from it; so if the solution can do full replication instead of striping, that would allow streaming from the local node only and we should be good.
 Am I looking in the right direction? Anyone attempting such an architecture?

 I'm looking for a self-hosted replacement for the likes of Emma and Yolt here in the UK. I've looked at Firefly III but understandably it cannot support syncing from any bank/credit card around the world.
 ​
 Did anybody solve this well?
 Is there a community maintained set of integrations for Firefly III I could tap into and contribute?
 ​
 I hate having my transaction records synced to a third party company I do not trust, and I need the automation of categorization these apps give. So time to solve this properly.

Wiretrustee can detect peers in the same internal network or with public IPs without restricted NAT, and it will connect Wireguard peers directly without the need for a local go-proxy.
 Kernel Wireguard detection. The native Wireguard (shipped with Linux as a kernel module) will be used if available.

A NAS wouldn't be great, due to the USB 2.0 ports. I do have a couple small OLED displays kicking around I could wire up to it maybe, displaying stats of some kind? I guess I could move my PiHole install back over to it maybe? 
 Anything outside the box anyone can suggest that it could do, even with the low specs by today's standards?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a homelab enthusiast. Not a network engineer. I pretty good with reverse proxies, vm's, and containers. Possibly because I'm bored and want to learn new tools and information I'm interested in learning about HA setups. I've tinkered with Docker Swarm, however it seems most of the information on web is really focused on K8s. I've recently watched a lot videos on Consul and K3s and it seems like a lot of the concepts with these setups are the same. I'm struggling however with terminology, ingress controllers and honestly with a lot of examples pulling in things that aren't explained very well -- such as manifests and service files. What are some good resources to learn about this technology? I'm not opposed for paying for courses. K3s seems to be possibly more applicable for homelab than K8s since I don't need all the cloud technology backed into the software however I'm not sure if I'm even asking the right questions.
 Thanks for any opinions and comments regarding resources I should consult.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m running Ombi and Plex, for myself and my family consistently, as well as some fun things here and there from this subreddit as things pop up. Also I run chrome Remote Desktop so that I can monitor and tinker remotely when I have downtime at work. But in the last month, I’ve come home to see my gpu at 100% usage, and the first time the person had it set to disable when in use, so I only noticed it because I have AIDA64 on a mini monitor and digging through task manager I found they had installed an exe in a public folder. The second time it happened was yesterday. I noticed the usage, immediately went through all the steps to remove it again, but there it was in a public folder. 
 With that said how can I have all these things that are connected or connectable outside my home network without the risk of those same ports being used by nefarious people?
 At this point I’ve killed all access and locked down my firewall. But what can I do differently, or is this just the risk that comes with all that?
 The worst part is after the first time I installed Acronis True Image which offers cryptojacking protection specifically. Needless to say it was completely useless in preventing the second attack. 
 I’m sorry if this is not a good place for this, but I feel like someone new to self-hosting, could also experience these seem attacks.
 EDIT 1: Followed a ton of advice about killing rdp. Did that. Somehow- this person connected again, via power shell and did their thing and installed their stuff again.
 This is with glasswire, windows firewall and Acronus protection all running and nothing caught it. WTH!

 - Dropdown select column: Choose one or more choices from a group of options. Also useful to group rows by.
 - Date & Time column types: Set dates with or without a time, in various different formats.
 ​
 Rofolia also supports:
 - Real time collaboration
 - Linking records between tables and creating links from existing values
 - Grouping and sorting, including nested grouping
 - Applying formulas per row
 - Api access for reading and writing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to self hosting and I'm looking to upgrade from my Raspberry Pi 4 to a server based on x86_64 architecture.
 I feel slightly overwhelmed with all the options (which is a good thing I guess) there are. I believe a mini server would fit my needs well, as I want to mount it under my desk I use daily.
 Could you please guide me into what kind of server (feel free to recommend me any) I should take a look at, given the following:
  
private use (small user base: around 3 users)
 as small as possible, as I want to mount it under my desk (mini server)
 silent, as I want to mount it under my desk (I prefer a server without fans, as long as cooling is sufficient)
 energy efficient, as it should operate 24/7 (small energy footprint)
 m.2 ssd (I don't want to use a hdd at all, given how cheap ssds are nowadays)
 network interface that supports 1000 Mbit/s
 ubuntu (this might change) as the os
 every service should run from a docker container: NextCloud, Portainer, Plex Media Server, PiHole, Bitwarden, Papermerge etc.
 server will be exposed through a reverse proxy such as npm
 budget: up to 400€ (I don't think I will need to spend this amount, given my requirements are low)
 as a reference: the Pi 4 (had a hdd connected to it) was "ok" performance wise. I prefer the x86_64 architecture though and would like more performance :)
  
​
 I'm fine building the server myself. I'm also fine buying a used one.

 I went shopping for POE cameras and ordered a few Reolink RLC-410-5MP. These are well priced and seemed to be fairly well regarded. I then set out looking at NVR software options. The main contenders I could see in this space were Blue Iris, Zone Minder, and Shinobi. For what I wanted to achieve though, these all seemed overkill.
 In the meantime, the cameras arrived and I quickly discovered that these Reolink cameras have their own in-built motion detection and are able to upload clips to an FTP server upon detection. This made me think…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently host some files on OneDrive and Google Drive, but I'd much rather self-host it, maintaining a live backup on backblaze B2.
 My plan is a rclone cronjob running a frequent backup to backblaze(few times an hour), but I'm a bit afraid about whether it will run into problems. For example if a drive dies, and I run an rclone sync. Does anyone have a better idea?
 I don't want to access the files straight off of backblaze though, so I want to self-host cloud storage. I don't need a lot of fancy features, the main thing I want is some kind of live syncing when you remove/add something to the directory, just like how dropbox, onedrive, and google drive do it. I guess I could technically just use samba in combination with a VPN for when I'm outside of the network, but I'd really rather have a more robust solution for when I don't have VPN credentials handy.
 I'm running proxmox, I tried installing nextcloud in a container but I ran into some issues regarding permissions with the bind mount and I wasn't sure if it was right for me either.

I know you could easily create users/passwords and whatnot, but I would want users to be able to sudo all they want within their own sandbox. I'm looking at this more from a classroom training standpoint. At the end of the day just destroy all of them and recreate again. I'm wondering if you could mass deploy a bunch of LXCs in Proxmox perhaps?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use several selfhosted services but am having a lot of difficulty with the networking aspects
 It is frustrating that I am able to get most things running but do not have the skills or knowledge to fix them if they go wrong even slightly
 1: Mix of different devices and network equipment:
 A: Windows 10 PC with several shared drives in SMB B: ASUs router, 3 x Eero In Bridge mode, Virgin Cable router 200/50 mbit C: Virtualbox running Yunohost serving RSS-Bridge, Nitter and Searx - this is the most reliable part of them all to be fair D: Raspberry Pi 4 8gb running dietpi but really only used for PiHole at moment E: NUC running Plex Server F: Mainly Ios devices in the home G: No IOT devices H: Mullvad VPN running on main pc only at present - needed to mask torrent and bypass the isp blocks on some sites here 
 2: several services I would like to be able to connect to from outside the network- currently done via port forwarding through the ASU’s router but this seems very unreliable as well as insecure 
 3: example of Sonarr I am unable to access even on LAN from a different pc but can view with no issue on the Windows PC it runs on (Firewall is off and I have changed ports several times, Radarr works fine on same machine) 
 4: I do own a domain but it’s not being used right now
 5: Ideally I do not want to have to spend a lot more money fixing what I have already spent a lot on buying
 6: I am very open to suggestions on what to do to get this all into a better shape. Pretty comfortable in Windows but very much a beginner with Linux

I'm pretty new to this, I have a personal linux server set up (LAMP Stack, port forwarding 80 and 443, have a domain name that im pretty sure is pointing to my server) and I'm looking to host a website for my "personal brand". I can load up the website fine on my home network via the domain name but once I go anywhere else, I cannot do a google search and pull my website up.
 Am I missing a step? Should I be trying a different approach? I'm just not sure lol
 Thank you in advance for reading this and giving my problem some thought, I greatly appreciate it :)

 I'm unhappy with Trello right now. I'm looking at Restya. I know it doesn't have automatizations, but I guess what I need I can just do manually.
 What I'm curious about is what self-hosted means and how do I do it?
 like, is it, do I install it on my computer and android? I don't understand, can I use it outside of my own computer and android? like can I use it on another computer if I have it on mine?
 Is it too hard for someone who doesn't know about coding and all that to use? should I just stick with Trello?
 Thank you

 I'm a little confused about how I should set things up with respect to my domain. Currently I have something like the following
 --- CURRENT --- mydomain.tld -> gitlab pages cloud.mydomain.tld -> nextcloud docker container --- PLANNED --- mydomain.tld -> gitlab pages cloud.mydomain.tld -> reverse proxy -> internal IP address/port of nextcloud container other.mydomain.tld -> reverse proxy -> internal IP address/port of other container seconddomain.tld -> undecided other.seconddomain.tld -> reverse proxy -> internal IP address/port of other2 container 
 I currently have both domain's DNS handled via Cloudflare.
 Questions:
  
 Should the reverse proxy itself be a docker container or should it run directly on the os itself?
  Where should the Let's Encrypt SSL cert generation be handled with respect to each domain/subdomain? 
 Handled in the reverse proxy?
 Handled within each of the respective containers?
 Something else?

Not really sure if I'm making the question more complicated... but someone please enlighten me. Thank You.

 Horahora is a videohosting website facilitating content archival from other websites (Niconico, Bilibili, and YT). Users can specify categories of content they wish to archive from other websites, and the software will correctly sync content in that category to the intended storage backend (currently Backblaze) and database (postgres). This tool was designed in the interest of facilitating collaborative archival (e.g. many users collectively determine what to archive), but also supports local, single-user use.
 Usage instructions are included in the README. Discord is https://discord.gg/vfwfpctJRZ , feel free to bug me if things are broken or don't make sense. There are many things to be improved (UI especially, I'm a weeabdev not a webdev), so I'd like to get a sense of how people want things to be prioritized.

 I went to setup Nextcloud on a VM last night and I immediately ran into something I'm unsure about - what OS should I use? I don't need fancy desktop environments or extra bloat like OS's that come packaged with libreoffice, thunderbird, firefox, etc.
 For you guys self-hosting in VMs, how do you decide what OS to use? Is there an OS that's generally seen as the go-to default OS for self-hosting apps on VMs? Or do you just pick something familiar like Ubuntu/CentOS and not worry about the extra bloat?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many of you, I'm using Nginx Proxy Manager. It been a great tool so far. What would be the best way to add basic monitoring and/or stats for the proxy? Just something like how many hits a proxy has gotten, errors, etc. Most of this data is in the logs, so really could just be a web GUI on top of that I suppose.
 From what I can tell, Nginx Proxy Manager is just a dressed up version of Nginx, so maybe just a standard plug-and-play nginx monitoring tool would work?
 It looks like Traefik has a bit more of this functionality built in, but I really like Nginx Proxy Manager and would rather not switch if I don't have to.
 Thanks!
 edit: I'm running Nginx Proxy Manager in docker
 something like this could work...https://learn.netdata.cloud/guides/collect-apache-nginx-web-logs but I'm guessing I'd need to mess with the log collector to run inside the nginx container, which doesn't seem too great...but that may be unavoidable as any external monitoring solution (ie not native to nginx) would need access to the logs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys n ladies! :)
 I‘ve a question related to this posts title.
 I set up a nextcloud server with a storage box on a Hetzner server. Working really good (went the docker way) and i like nextcloud pretty much.
 The main purpose i am using a VPS with a storage box is that my internet connection at home is pretty slow (80/15) regarding file transfer. If my upload would be better i would have hosted everything locally, maybe in the future.
 So i would like to have a bidirectional sync between my Nextcloud data and a local folder on my synology nas. This way all my files are in my local network and i could access them quickly because of gbit lan and on the other side i can access them quickly everywhere else because of the good upload speed from the VPS.
 And the main reason is also that if i change files locally, they can be synced to my nextcloud and vice versa.
 The only way i found would be WebDAV with Cloud Sync. But is that the best and only way?
 I tried also with a vpn connection and mount the nextcloud files folder to the nas and with sftp mount. Then with rsync, but thats not really working like i want to.
 Du you have some ideas?
 Greetings :)

 I was thinking I could do this with MailCow and an email relay, but the ones I find online like sendgrid or mailgun only talk about sending email, not receiving it, or need a webhook to forward the received email. 
 Is there a service which could be setup for cheap to receive email for arbitrary mailboxes and arbitrary domains for cheap, which would then be polled by Mailcow to download the email, then delete it from their service?
 My main domain is with a reputable specialized email host, but want a cheap way to setup alternate domains for testing and side projects. I am not looking to send too many emails, but might want to setup some kind of mailing list at some point. I'm not too concerned about the privacy, or even reliability (within reason), as long as it can guarantee mail availability for at least 24h and email I send through them will not be blocked by gmail or outlook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background:
 I've recently set up a torrent seedbox/mini home server on my Raspberry Pi 3something. I've got it running qBittorrent-nox, Aria2 (following this and this tutorials,with AriaNg frontend served via Apache), and filebrowser/SFTP/Samba for file access. I had some other services running, but I've stopped them for the moment. I've set Aria2 and qBittorrent to download to /media/pi/Downloads, which is the automatic mount point for my 500GB HDD (NTFS, via FUSE)
 Problem: 
 It doesn't download torrents. When I add a torrent in qBittorrent web interface, it'll grab the metadata, list tens or hundreds of peers, then I'll watch the download speed drop down from KB/s to bytes/s to zero and stop. The same torrent, when added to the Aria2 web interface, will download slowly (though I have seen the first one I tried download at 4 Mbit/s which is very good for my internet). I'm nervous to stick exclusively with Aria2, however, as, despite downloading the torrents, I can't tell whether it seeds them or not. It goes into "seeding" mode, but uploads remain at 0 Kb/s. I need to be able to seed, to use it with a private tracker or two.
 Question:
 Can anyone please help me figure out what's wrong with qBittorrent, why it's not downloading or seeding torrents, and how to fix it? Is Aria2 actually seeding and I just can't see it? Is there any way to tell?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys.
 I don't really know which sub is right for me since I wasn't able to find the cause of the problem yet.
 My setup:
 Home Server running OMV (debian) and Nextcloud 21.0.2, wireguard and a few other services.
 Port forwarding on my ISPs Router (80+443+wireguard port) for my nextcloud instance and wireguard.
 Dyndns and a cname record with my dyndns record at cloudflare, which is the DNS Nameserver for my domain.
 If I decide to use cloudflare as a proxy, everything works as expected with the disadvantage of slower upload speeds from my local network, since everything has to pass "the internet" instead of staying in my local network. But nextcloud is fast, responsible and just works.
 If I on the other hand use "only DNS" without cloudflares proxy, my whole nextcloud instance is barely usable. Every loading of a page takes 10-30s and I sometimes even get a timeout.
 I did not change anything on the configuration of my router, nextcloud or anything. I at most updated my OMV via (apt-get update && apt-get upgrade) and my ISP is rolling out automatic updates to my router without letting me know or decide about it. 
 What could be a good starting point to locate the cause of this issue? Has someone experienced similar issues? Thanks for your help and sorry for my bad english.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kind of plans do people have in place for disaster recovery? I thinking house burned down and you lost everything. 
 I've got off site backups. But they are encrypted, the encryption keys are in Bitwarden and I'm not self hosting that. To access Bitwarden I know my master password but I need 2FA, which would be the authenticator app on my phone or my YubiKey, both of which may be lost in a fire. I could also use email but that's just shifting the problem because again I'd need my phone and Bitwarden to get into that. There's also the recovery code but where should I keep that so it's secure and recoverable? 
 I feel like once I get into Bitwarden the rest is easy, I can access my emails, off site backups, and decryption keys. It might take a while but I think it would be doable assuming I had that recovery code.
 Does anyone ever test their DR plan? Can you eventually access decrypted backups with nothing but a new computer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Trying to figure out how to best host my photos and move away from hosted cloud. Previously I hosted own cloud and switched to nextcloud.
 Currently paused sync untill all my files are nicely structured again and was researching photo management. Photoprism seams a clear winner. My goal would be to sync my photos from laptop and phone to nextcloud and have photoprism recognize all important features.
 A few questions arise when reading through it all: -does photoprism need to make a extra copy of that file? Or will it just add all the info to the "nextcloud" photo. (plenty of storage, so not a major issue) -will the photoprism info also show in the nextcloud environment? -is there a android app to browse through my photos or can I only access it via webinterface -does it change file structure (Pictures/2021/2021-01/filename.jpg)
 Ideally all my photos would be indexed/labeled on all devices so a backwards sync option would be great but not sure that is in the scope of all platforms involved. 
 Is there a clear instruction to run it without docker?

 I followed this tutorial about setting up Docker with Traefik reverse proxy and Portainer as I thought it would suit the set up I would like to achieve. Previously I've run services with Apache virtual hosts. 
 While it's taken me a while to get a basic handle on Docker it seems like it might be a quicker easier way to deploy and maintain services - once I get to grips with it. If anyone feels this tutorial doesn't create a good foundation to build on please let me know, or point me to a better one.
 What I'd like is secure access to service1.mydomain.com, service2.mydomain.com etc. For what it's worth I'm looking at running Seattle, Plex, Pihole, Tautulli, and perhaps Syncthing and maybe another music-oriented media server (Jellyfin?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been running Nextcloud off of Diepti on my RPi3B+ for the past 3 years, and the experience has always been excellent so far: packages are well optimised, updates have rarely caused any issue, and the system image is very minimal and decently performant on my low specc'ed SBC. 
 I have recently happened to look again at Yunohost, and the project seems to have really matured in the past 4 years. I am tempted to switch to their solution, especially to benefit from the plentiful stack of packages available and optimised. 
 My question for you fellow self-hosters is this: has anyone had any experience with Yunohost, and specifically their Nextcloud package, on a RPi? Does it work well enough? Have you had the chance to compare it with Dietpi's version?

 One thing I did like about OMV (and other pre-made self-hosting distros) is that all the important pieces are already put into place for you. Are there any self-hosting server checklists so I don't forget to do something important?

 Disabled, which causes transactions not to affect holdings in any way. This is perfect if you're too lazy to record your transactions and just want to keep track of your holdings.
 Mixed, where you can edit your holdings, but transactions also affect them and are added/subtracted based on the transaction type (buy/sell).

 For some context, I've recently turned an old laptop of mine into a LAMP server and I've gotten it set up with my custom domain and everything. However, I've noticed that I cannot access my custom website or anything from my server unless I'm on the same network that my server is on. 
 I've set up an OpenVPN server on it, and it works when I'm on the network, but my connection times out when I try to connect from another network.
 Basically, I'd like to be able to work on/have full admin access to my server when I'm at work or something but I don't really know what I'm doing.
 Thank you in advance for yourself!

It is a Core 2 Duo T9900 that was repurposed with Debian. Performance with that has been adequate until recently.

The 1 TB drive is more then enough for my needs but I think I need to put this on a new platform. I would like to stay away from Raspberry Pi itself as the hardware as I would like to use a plain SATA (or small ssd) drive.

 I have CGNAT at home so unfortunately i cannot port forward. I also have cloudflared (tunnelling service from cloudflare) which i use to route my domain name to my *arr's and NPM to. However uploading/downloading non html content through the tunnel is a violation of the ToS of cloudflare so I cannot use that service for UL/DL from/to Nextcloud.
 Enter Zerotier. As it looks from other forums/blogs and websites this looks to be the solution to my CGNAT problem, HOWEVER, I cannot for the life of me figure out the correct steps to set this up. Ive been following these steps:

 Follow up to: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/o7ham9/selfhosted_imapsmtp_autoresponder/
 Background: I have several mail accounts, that don't support proper out-of-office / vacation notices. I was pretty sure, I would find an easy imap&smtp-based solution that could run on my own server. I did find.... nothing.
 Well not quite, I did find a gist on github, that essentally gave me a solid foundation to push this further myself.
 Long story short, here is: praul/autoreply (https://github.com/praul/autoreply)
 You can run this in a docker-container or baremetal on python. It supports multiple mail accounts, date-time ranges and re-reply timeouts.

 I currently use Google password manager for pretty much everything as I use Chrome desktop and own a Android phone.
 On my Google account I have setup 2FA and account activity, however, I have a concern that all the security of my accounts purely rely on no one getting access to my Google account. 
 Would using Bitwarden really elevate that? And is it worth the risk moving it from a reliable cloud service to a self hosted system?

 Link to MonicaCRM
 The specific issue I'm having is any docker-compose file you make doesn't seem to matter when it comes to MySQL credentials. The app appears to be obsessed with having the db username has 'homestead'. I have no idea why, I've asked on the 'Dockerholics' group on Facebook and nobody seems to know.
 However, I've seen that someone of you have managed to install it? Could you shine some light on it?
 This is my YAML for the stack, the only thing I've changed is the app secret. I've tried changing the MySQL credentials to various things but the log still outputs this:
 "MySQL Connection Error: (1045) Access denied for user 'homestead'@'172.24.0.3' (using password: YES)"

 I've found a few older posts and look at some software but they appear to be very much geared toward businesses. I also looked at Firefly but it seems to be very manual on the imports. If there isn't really anything that can do automatic imports and I have to go manual route that's fine, just not sure if there is anything better then firefly. 
 Thanks!!

 for a long Time I searched for a self hosted solution for my Song collection. I was with none of the options I tried really happy. So I decided to develop my own one.
 Hypnos - The selfhosted audio cloud
 Hypnos reads your Songs from a local folder. It uses the Metadata in the files and can use the cover art in the same folder as the Songs/Album. It is 100% free (GPL3) software. Including the javascript(LibreJS compatible). It consists of a back-end service written in rust called Soil and a Typescript front-end called Solanum.
 Your songs will transparently be transcoded to a format that your Browser will understand if required.
 While Hypnos is still very primitive in many areas (no playlist, no user management, etc..) the core feature browsing an playing your Music works.
 I'm posting this here in case some of you find Hypnos interesting/useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Last week I released auto-docker-dash a simple dashboard to show you the status of your docker containers.
 After a massive overhaul of the application, this week we've rebranded and it's now known as Plugsy.
 ​
 https://reddit.com/link/o8w7h5/video/eavyy8orys771/player
 New features
 Connectors
 Plugsy now supports multiple connectors that can gather status' independently. This will allow us to build many more connector types in the future such as Kubernetes, Traefik, Caddy etc. I'd love to get some feedback on which would be useful to the self-hosted community.
 Connectors that are currently supported:
 Docker
 This is the original, but with the new file configuration, you can now add multiple docker instances/sockets to gather statuses from different locations
 Website
 This is a simple connector that will perform a simple status code check for the given URL, it can also check for a specific regex in the response.
 Raw
 For those links that you just want on your dashboard, you can now include them directly in config.
 Agent Mode
 Plugsy now supports agent mode, allowing you to push changes from 1 Plugsy container to another.
 This is useful should you have multiple docker/connected environments that you'd like to monitor from a single dashboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 After a long hiatus of matrix after being a very early adopter I have dived back in.
 Lets just say playbook was a little bit perplexing until I worked out what I was doing.
 Its setup quite nice and have multiple bridges running, which has really allowed me to get rid of Facebook messenger and other spyware off my phone. (sadly it is well used among friends)
 What I cant seem to understand at present, is how often should I be pulling in the new git playbook and essentially running an update?
 Is it mature enough that I can just insert this into an update script and run at leisure? Or do I need to keep an eye on the changelog for monumental breaking things? Can I just set up a watch for the playbook changelog file in git and update only when that is listed as changed, etc.
 What are you doing to keep it updated?

 It got quite a lot of interest so I've continued to develop it and it now has Octopart support in the latest version.
 Full details can be found on the Github page, and you can either install it as a standard Django app in a virtual environment or use one of the containers (I build for most architectures, happy to add more if there's one you really need!)
 It's released under the MIT license, so all issues/suggestions/pull requests are welcome!

Just a few days was enough to convince me to self host it. The best part was that their official docker-compose.yml requires little tweaks to make it production ready.
 ​
 If anyone is looking for an open source self hosted analytics, I strongly recommend plausible.
 I have made a blog post on making it production ready (including nginx reverse proxy and TLS certs using let's encrypt)

It's not really open source in the full sense. More like only "we publish the source". They do not interact with the community and Github issues are either ignored or replied with a single sentence and then ignored.
 Their Docker image is terrible. It runs as root, and even worse, it is chained to their own MariaDB configuration (it requires me to give it root password of my MariaDB)
 Files are stored in their proprietary format. I understand that this is necessary for deduplication and file history to work, but the tools to deal with that format are a hassle…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Self-Hosters, 
 I was wondering if anyone is able to recommend a good self-hosted financial management system. Ideally what I'm looking for is:
  
Handle multiple Income accounts
 Track multiple savings goals across different bank accounts
 Handle redraw mortgage accounts
 Have a web UI for managing across the local network
  
I'm not really fussed about importing transactions directly from my bank, I can enter that manually (and am just about paranoid enough to not trust any service). Currently, I'm using a google spreadsheet to tell me how much I need to add to each account on a fortnightly basis and to record expenditure against those accounts. I don't need to generate invoices.
 Preferring a self-hosted system rather than something I login to over the internet for privacy reasons, and would like something that I can put in a container or a VM so that its accessible on the home network for my wife to be able to access.
 Something simple to use would be a bonus (to keep the wife happy). 
 Also I'm not an accountant, so if I haven't explained myself very well please let me know. 
 Thanks everyone!

 I want to share Plex with my friends - the easy way. Since I'm behind a double Nat I can't forward any ports. My setup is:
 My Plex server is a local unraid NAS. Tailscale is installed in a docker. 
 Tailscale is also installed on a public facing VPS. This VPS is running nginx Proxy Manager, making Plex avaible at a public domain, secured with SSL.
 My question is: Is it possible to sniff (see what type of contend is streamed)? Every connection is encrypted, but does that mean that it is impossible to know what is streamed? (I'm a noob when it comes to that, sorry). I just don't want to get post from authorities or layers demanding huge amounts of money because of my media server.
 Thank you for reading this, sorry for my bad English :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pterodactyl Panel is a wrapper around docker which is intended to help create and manage game servers.
 I have a VPS server that I've been using for the past 3 years and I host a few light-weight applications on there. Recently, a group of friends and I decided we want to play Valheim and I thought it'd be a great idea to host a dedicated server on the VPS using pterodactyl panel.
 Now, I wouldn't say I'm an expert at this. I'm a software developer by trade, but in setting up various things on my VPS I've learned a thing or two over the years.
 But Pterodactyl Panel has defeated me. It is written in PHP. I followed both official documentation and community guides. I asked countless questions on their discord. I am faced by problem after problem, some of which I can't find any help with at all. It's a nightmare. The only solution I see is to either hire a sysadmin to do this for me, or to look for alternatives.
 Anyway, sorry about the rant. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 I've also considered just dumping pterodactyl entirely and just building my own docker images with the servers I need. Would that be a better idea?

 for some time already I've been working on setting up my all-in-one self-hosted home server that one day should server as my go-to for many things ranging from development to NAS. I'm trying to manage as much as possible from a single repository with Ansible. At the moment I'm at the current state:
  
Ubuntu Server
 K3s Kubernetes cluster single node
 ZFS Pool with a bunch of HDDs
 SSDs
 bunch of other smaller things
  
So far I have not a single utility running that requires any persistent storage. This obviously has to change. And with that I also have to think about redundancy, backups, restoring, and so on. Doing all this on a plain filesystem would be nothing new to me.
 A few random questions:
  
Should I handle backup and snapshots of stuff running in K8s also in K8s? Or do everything on the host OS?
 hostPath volumes? local persistent volumes? longhorn? velero?
  
Would be great if you could share your take on this topic.

 Consider it like what pi-hole is for DNS queries, same thing for port 80 and 443 , so that all requests and responses can be logged and analysed in a cool dashboard.
 Custom solution that I know is : 
  
Add nginx logging in a linux box, pass all router traffic to it
 setup EKS , filebeat / logstash for parsing these logs, Elastic search as a datastore and Kibana for beautiful graphs and analysis.
  
​
 But will like to have a plug and play and a beautiful pi-hole like project if such a thing exists.
 For reference something like this software does also:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am using onedrive storage + android app to manage automatic backup of photos from my phone and cameras. 
 I am looking for a solution that will allow a unidirectional "backup" of this data from onedrive to my server I.e. create a local copy every x days. As far as I know onedrive doesn't have native folder sync with ubuntu.
 I am wanting to do it this way (rather than phone->server->cloud) as I can't trust 99.9% uptime of my own hardware.
 At the same time I want to package up backups of my docker configs/data and send that to onedrive.
 Can this be done easily with syncthing or rsync?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks, your help will be much appreciated, a client of mine asked me if there's any way he can make his service more speedy and up to modern days. 
 Current workflow:
 He does dental prosthesis, so, one dentist sends him a piece to work with an attached paper order with the name of the patient and what's needed to be done. So he inputs patient name/type of job/date to be delivered into google calendar and that's pretty much it. This might happen a few times with the same piece of work. Every other detail is manually typed in some excel that its only accessible locally. 
 Intended workflow:
 Input patient name/type of job/date to be delivered with a tracking number so any dentist can view in which state the job is, possibly with a QR code that could be printed in the labels for each dentist to keep track of how many jobs are done monthly with each one.
 Of course more features can be applied, I was thinking this more as a logistics kind of software rather than a medical one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started making ChoreRewards a few weeks ago, which is essentially a reward system build for children. If the child does a chore, they get points which they can then use to "purchase" items. 
 It's purpose is to give children the sense of accomplishment, as they will be able to mark their chores as "done" and to teach the value of money; should I purchase X now, or save up my "points" and purchase Y? 
 Anyway, V0.1 of the backend is almost ready and I thought I'd see if there are any frontend devs who want to help me build it out? 
 I can do frontend, by which I mean I can muddle around and make something functional; but I don't have a UX bone in my body.
 Happy to discuss more about the project, answer questions, or tell me you're interested in the project itself if you think it might be something you can use when it's ready!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure if this has been discussed recently, but I am looking for an iCloud alternative for my Apple devices. I know there are lots of services that can replace some individually (like using NextCloud), but I am looking for what the best options are. One thing that I am really wanting is something similar to iMazing which looks like an amazing product but just a little outside my use case (and if something else will do it for free, all the better).
 What I like about iMazing is that I can backup and manage all of my data (messages, photos, apps, the works) from a remote location with a UI that is very similar to iTunes. I'm trying to set up a family backup of photos and iPhones for my parents and siblings and so having that ease of use is key. The downside of iMazing is that the unlimited plan only lets me have 2 computers with keys so only myself and one other household can manage their devices or I can get lifetime keys for 10 devices but I need more future proofing because we will have more iPhones in the family inevitably. 
 What is your setup for iOS backup and management for your home setups and specifically what is your ideal photo backup setup that you use for those people who aren't tech savvy (i.e parents/siblings).

 I am running a small hypervisor with about 50 vm's for me and some friends.
 One of them pointed me at sonatype's repomanager that would let me cache registries like apt, yum, dnf, npm, docker etc. 
 This would speed up lots of things in our environment. However it seem like there is no CE of this product and it costs a yearly subscription fee.
 Is there a simular product like repomanager I could use?
 Any reccomendations welcome :)

To access Jellyfin from the outside I was planning on using reverse proxy on the same container I was holding Jellyfin, but I'm thinking of having a server do all the proxy of the whole network (so I can avoid having to write down the ports every time I have to enter the interface of something).
 But I have no idea how to do that. First I'm doubting whether I should use Nginx, Apache, Caddy (since I've heard it's fairly easy to setup) or something like Traefik, and once chosen that how I'd have to make it so everything goes through the proxy to then be redirected.
 Any tips or suggestions?

 A friend of mine, who also self hosts his email did also receive a dmarc report for his domain, also from mail.ru.
 I guess someones currently trying to mass-impersonate?
 Are there any of you guys, that also received such a report? 
 As far as I know there is not much I can do prevent them from pulling this kind of shit, is it?
 Does stuff like this happen often? I've only been selfhosting my email for about a year now and I've never seen a dmarc report that I didn't trigger myself...

 I'm looking for a selfhosted autoresponder for multiple mail accounts from different providers. 
 Not all of them are offering decent autoresponder settings on the server side.
 The autoresponder would have to check for new emails over imap and then send autoresponds over smtp.
 Basically just like an email client with filters, but running on a 24-7 server - and not interfering with the actual email clients.
 Does anyone know a good solution?
 Thanks in advance
 edit: my google searches return a lot of newsletter tools. I'm not looking for anything newsletter related. Just a simple "I'm on vacation" Message on incoming email.
 in Germany we use the term autoresponder for it. This maybe wrong. I'm looking for a tool that sends "out of office" notices

Because I'd like it to be open-source, I looked into Nextcloud, which is awesome but it lacks goal-tracking and a wiki, which I'd really like to have. I have also looked into "Personal Management System", which looks really interesting, but it lacks the community behind Nextcloud in order to earn my trust to use it in the long run. Ideally it would be awesome to be able to visualize all aspects of life, while retrieving this data from the top services of each category. Imagine a home page with a Kanboard from WeKan, storage from Nextcloud, goal tracking (maybe Nomie?), some notes in form of a wiki...
 ​
 What sort of set up would you recommend that satisfies this, or at least gets close to it? Sorry if I make some mistakes, English is not my first language.
 ​
 ** Maybe someone may suggest that I should contribute to some of these projects in order to create the features I wish to see. I would love to, however at this moment in time I lack the necessary skills.
 ** EDIT **
 Let me clarify for those who didn't get the gist of what I'm trying to communicate: I'm looking for something analogous to what Android/iOS is to Widgets. 
 You have a main screen that show information and functionalities from the system or third party services/apps that are easily visualized and/or manipulated. So far I found Nextcloud+nextcloud apps to satisfy most of these needs, but I still miss some resources as mentioned above. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting here at the recommendation on another subreddit. 
 I have about 1500 movie/TV Series library all on DVD's/BD. I took the time to rip the entire library. I took my time and it took me about 3 years to rip and convert it. Unfortunately a good 2/3 of the files were corrupted because of a bad RAID set up I was using at the time. I have since upgraded to a 4K TV and set up the latest Apple TV and I wanted to rebuild my library. I'm wondering if there's a better way to do this. Not only is ripping/transcoding time consuming, but now that I finally own a 4K HDR TV, there's no pointing re-ripping my DVD collection. I have hard copies, so I think licensing isn't an issue. I also have a spreadsheet with name of every movie I own with IMDB link. Is there a better way to do this? Torrent? How would I automate this on my TrueNAS and just have it slowly rebuild it overtime...mostly unattended of course. Is this possible?

 I was thinking to host a few projects using a cellphone internet data plan as a failover when my actual internet is out.
 Can anyone point me in the right direction as to a good device to route a cellphone internet plan, and basically make a hotspot for home usage?
 I think I looked this up before, and the decent one I think is like $500, but I can't remember the dang name of the device.
 Also, are there even cellphone providers that allow this?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I run docker on my synology nas along with a few containers, including the above. Within the containers i sometimes have a hard time accessing lan devices. For instance, if i am using node red and i put a tp link kasa node, it finds nothing. If i were to run node red on my raspberry pi and apply the same node it finds all my lan tp link smart plugs. Besides adding the containers to a macvlan on the synology nas, is there any other way to get around this issue? I created a macvlan, but now the issue is whenever i connect to my home vpn (it runs on the same nas as docker) i can not access those ips on the macvlan.
 ​
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 Over the past week or two I have been working on a web application that allows you to explore your DJI drone footage on a map! I am finally confident enough to tell you about it, so that those interested can test it and try it for themselves. 
 In order for it to work the footage has to have been shot with the subtitle telemetry settings enabled.
 https://github.com/vimodev/dronemap
 https://hub.docker.com/r/vimodev/dronemap
 Features
  
Footage directory scanning
 Automatic parsing and analysis of DJI footage
 Exploration of extracted datapoints on a map
 Filtering map markers based on footage attributes
 Watching raw footage from which data points originated
  
Screenshots
 Example usage.
 Satellite view.
 OpenStreetMap view.
 Inspecting a datapoint.
 ​
 Viewing datapoint origin in original footage.
 Remarks
  
The styling is lackluster due to my personal disregard for design. It can of course be improved in due time.
 It has been developed with and tested for DJI Mini 2 footage only. I have no other footage available to me. I am running with the assumption that other DJI footage is in the same format with regards to the subtitled data points DJI optionally includes.
 If you encounter any issues please submit them on github.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, first time posting to this sub. I've spent the last week scouring the interwebs and I haven't found anyone talking about what I'm trying to do. Any help would be very greatly appreciated. 
 I'm trying to connect two remote locations together. Both locations have a dynamic IP address. Everything I've seen so far has suggested using a Dynamic DNS service or buying a domain name and using a free Dynamic DNS. Those are great ideas but I know there's got to be a way to do this for free. If it can't be done, then it can't be done, but purely on principle I feel like it's total bullshit that there's no free alternatives that don't rely on the whim of an ISP or third party services. 
 This is what I was thinking, neither IP changes all that frequently, maybe once every month or 2. Additionally, it seems very unlikely that both IP's would change at exactly the same time. Would it be possible to run an automatic process at both locations that would constantly update their IP's to one another? 
 So we have location A and location B that constantly talk to each other and update the IP address. At location A, the IP address changes. Now, location B doest know the new IP address of location A. Because the two IP's didn't change at the same time, location A still knows the IP address of location B and subsequently can send the updated IP address. 
 Anyone know if anything like this exists or have any ideas for free alternatives? 
 On a side note, I have an old TPlink Archer A9 that I'm not using, it has a free Built-in ddns with tp-link. I switched over to an edge router. Is there anyway I could put the A9 in a DMZ on the network and have it only for updating the ddns? Could I switch to IPV6?
 Honestly, any free and automated ideas would be perfect. Would love to hear what you guys and gals think!
 Thanks again

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kasm Workspaces delivers interactive access to GUI applications and desktop environments running in docker containers. The containers are streamed directly to the browser. The platform is similar to Citrix and VMware Horizon, but entirely container based. 
 ​
 ​
 Kasm Workspaces
 ​
 The quickest way to see what we are about is to launch a demo session using any of the following links. No install - No sign-up - just solve a captcha. 
  
Ubuntu Bionic Desktop
 Google Chrome
 Visual Studio Code
  
(Note: Traffic filtering and timeout features are enabled to limit abuse)
 While Workspaces is a commercial product, we have roots in /r/selfhosted and /r/homelab style communities so it’s always been a priority to offer a free, self-hosted, easy-to-install, feature rich community edition. 
 ​
 The core components of the platform are also open source.
  
KasmVNC in the streaming tech used to deliver interactive access to the containers via the browser. (https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC)
 All of our application and desktop images are open source as well. (https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-images) - (https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-core-images)
  
​
 Folks commonly use Workspaces for….
  
Secure and private internet access leveraging disposable browser containers.
 Remote access solution for VDI (ahem CDI) / Development / Bastion Hosts / Training environments
 Integrate into existing platforms/environments by leveraging our API
 Slaying demons in hell
  
​
 If you'd like to run Workspaces yourself, you can Download and Install the software on popular Linux distros. I hope this provides something of value to this community and I appreciate any feedback. 
 Thanks to the mods for allowing me to post.

 I'm aware I could have nmap run periodically and diff the changes which would send an alert but I wondered if a tool already existed or as a part of an already existing NMS. It'd just be nice to have features like history and and nice web interface, like Shodan Monitor has.

I literally have no clue what I'm doing and know nothing about setting up this kind of stuff. I tried looking for other resources but the two or three websites I could find about this just used the same pictures lol. Can somebody hold my hand and walk me through how to set this up? If not, that's fine. I've been trying to figure this out for hours and coming here was my last resort. I'll probably just give up on it.

 I think it was called "rsync-diff" or "rsync-backup" or something but that doesn't bring anything up. Thanks in advance if anyone knows something.
 Edit: aah I just found it! It's called rsnapshot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Pretty much my entire question is in the subject line:
 If I Set Up Guacamole with 2FA behind a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX Proxy Manager), do I still need a VPN server? Why/why not?
 I realize using a VPN would be the most secure way to go about things, but I'm still pretty new to self-hosting, and I'm not entirely clear on what security vulnerabilities I'd be at risk for if I just set things up like this:
 remote client <--> public internet <--> https://guacamole.exampledomain.com (Cloudflare proxied domain with Cloudflare-issued SSL certificate) <--> NGINX Proxy Manager (reverse proxy) on RPI serving HTTPS connections <--> guacamole server with Google Authenticator/2FA on RPI (docker) <--> servers behind Guacamole.
 Assuming nothing evil is happening with the SSL certificate on my guacamole subdomain, where is the security risk that makes a VPN necessary? Is the concern packet sniffing while connected to the public internet at a Starbucks (that is, the use case for VPN generally), or is there something specifically insecure about running guacamole this way?

 Some of my main questions are:
  
Should I provide more inline comments or try to have all the explanations in their own box? 
 Is it easier or harder to follow when all the outputs are saved and displayed?
 Should I have the download scripts included or have the user download the images themselves?
  
Thanks for all the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Like the title says, I'm looking for a self-contained server or combination of code and packages (e.g.: nginx, Ruby, Python, etc) to host a local website with mostly documentation of my homelab.
 It should support online editing with an option for WYSIWYG (if possible), Markdown syntax and redering with Mermaid and/or PlantUML support and backend based on static files (.md and .yaml would be perfect).
 I've checked a number of open-source and free wiki and documentation packages out there that includes most features above, but they all seem to rely on some sort of database to store the data and settings.
 Relying on a database makes me worry about backup procedures and how to migrate the docs to different tool in the future. I'd rather prefer to just have a bunch of folders with md/png/svg/yaml files 😆 
 At the moment, I'm considering deploying a local Gitlab instance, it does all I need but the WYSIWYG editing.
 Would you have any suggestions? Likely, I skipped some obvious choices for you (say, e.g., perhaps WordPress does the job!), so please feel free to share any inputs, they'll be very appreciated.
 Thanks!

I am looking for a very simple solution to hosting/sharing a folder (+/-100GB) on my Mac mini with 3-5 friends. I use my Mac mini as a plex server so it is always running. I have a folder of various audiobooks, books and music that I want them to be able to access on their Mac/PC and download whatever they want whenever they want. Dropbox works nicely but I am not interested in paying for the extra storage and I don't need anything stored in the cloud. 
 What suggestion do you have for my best option to look into?

 I wrote a guide on setting up a Jolpin Server with Docker, Traefik and SSL. 
 With Joplin Server you have the possibility to host your notes yourself. There are a lot of desktop apps for almost every system and mobile apps for iOS and Android. 
 With optional end-to-end encryption, you also have one of the most secure note servers around.

 Let me know what you think of Joplin Server. I kicked out Nextcloud Notes and have recently started using only Jolpin and so far I'm very happy.

 Previously my wife & I used Out of Mil, which was nice. But not self-hosted. It did however, work. Now that they've been brought out and will no longer work for non US based users, we can no longer use it.
 Grocy looked like it may fit the bill, but it's a bit too complete. I need the all important spousal-approval factor. Adding a new item in a shopping list required setting the item up first, we just need something to show a checklist really.
 So, TL;DR. I'm looking for something, self hosted that'll allow us to create a list, with the ability to check items off as they're picked up. The list needs to be available to multiple users. Ideally needs a companion Android app, but PWA is perfectly fine too.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have been searching for a solution to my music 'needs'. Different solutions exist, but I seem to be unable to find a solution that just 'does it all'. Basically I'm looking for a selfhosted Spotify-like solution without the fancy 'I think you will like this music'-suggestions. :)
 I have a self built NAS with all my music on it, a receiver in my living room (Yamaha R-N303D, DLNA/Airplay capable), a RPi with speakers connected to it in my bathroom (running piCorePlayer at the moment), and a bunch of smartphones, tablets etc.
 I am looking for a selfhosted solution that enables me to:
  
maintain my music collection (e.g. scan music into a database, playlist manipulation, etc) using a nice web user interface
 listen to the music using a web browser (using the same nice web user interface), so that I can access my music remotely
 control what is playing on the home appliances in my home (receiver and RPi)
 sync subsets of my music files (certain playlists) to my tablets, smartphones, etc. so that I can listen to it while I'm offline (car, commute on public transportation, etc.)
  
The solutions that I found so far are either good at 1/streaming to a browser, or 2/ streaming to home appliances (for example Airsonic vs. Logitech Media Server). But I'm looking for a marriage of both.
 Any suggestions/thoughts on how I can achieve this?

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

It can serve its place somewhere in my network. So, I booted it up at first, being the first time I initially plugged it in, and got a "Booting..." on the LCD. I figured all was well so I moved it to my rack and plugged it in and now its shows "█ █ █ █ █ █ █ █" for some apparent reason. I dont know what happened as there is practically zero documentation pertaining to the issue. I've also tried resetting it but also did not work. 
 I figured maybe one of yall might've experience the same thing if youve ever had a Thecus NAS.

 I've been playing with docker a bit on my synology NAS and I think I'm ready to try something a bit more difficult. I'd like to set things up so that three small JAMStack-based (Gatsby and Hexo) websites I have could be built and deployed from my NAS instead of github actions.
 However, my knowledge of self-hosted build systems is very old (circa 2008). Does anyone have any suggestions for an environment that is working well for you? Currently the code for the sites is hosted on github and deployed to (very) inexpensive hosting via FTP, although that's subject to change as I bring more stuff back to the home network.

 So I got myself a RaspberryPi 4B 4Go and started everything from scratch. It took me like 2 months and several sleepless nights to manage to get a proper Nextcloud instance running, even though I can't get Collabora to work. So I decided to try and install CryptPad.

 I'm searching for a way to setup something Like Pritunl (or any other VPN Server) on a local machine, and make it accessible from the outside, so that I can share my Plesk Server and NAS with some friends.
 I don't have access to the router. I thought about services Like ngrok, but they are quite expensive for such a task, and I have enough VPS Servers and capacity to host something like that myself. 
 Since I'm fine with hosting it myself I wanted to ask you if you have any advice how to set it up the best way, or any Tutorial you could link me to.
 Thank you :)

 ​
 i already did a bit of research. My Company is looking for a documentation/wiki software which is self hosted and mostly free. We need advanced permission management, Active Directory support and it should be easy to use and to setup.
 ​
 I installed xwiki and wikijs. Both look kinda easy, but wikijs is the handling for users a bit difficulty in my opinion. XWiki looks like from 1990 but I guess its all dependable on extensions there. Overall it seems also to be way more complicated.
 ​
 Any hints on hidden gems or similiar?

 To be more precise, a simple HTML5 dashboard with an admin panel where we can set some ETF we want to follow, would be enough.

 I'm hosting multiple services at home, and was wondering what would be the best way to manage the domain names.

So it looks like jellyfin.domain.com, this.domain.com, than.domain.com... I'm sure there is an easier way ? Using a wildcard maybe ? And having NPM doing the redirection ?

 Ok so what i would really like to do is to share my jellyfin server library to friends and family without having them to type in my local ip address apparently that isnt safe and somehow my overseas friend is unable to access even if he enters my local ip address to the search bar.
 what i have now is my jellyfin server and a domain name that i bought from domain.com which seems to already come with the letsencrypt SSL thing is that really the case?
 From what i can tell from researching online there is a whole thing about using Caddy, Xampp, Apache etc which is all very confusing and im unable to make heads or tails about it.
 I would like help to know if there is any resource that clearly shows the steps i need to set up a reverse proxy for the specific use case that i would like to achieve. And even then is reverse proxy even what i need for this case or there is another workaround of redirecting localhost to my domain name?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have a little setup issue I’m trying to work through and need some help. I have successfully setup my Rpi4 as a Wireguard server with Pihole also installed. I have created a few clients and all can connect to the pi no problem. Here’s the issue I'm having trouble with- I have a Synology server I’m trying to setup for external connection ONLY through the PiVPn. I bought a USB-Ethernet adapter and plugged the Syno into it (the Pi) but I cannot connect to it when I do, not even locally. I would like to disable Syno’s quickconnect as it’s a security hole and I want to shut any ports that are not absolutely necessary. How can I utilize the Pi as a VPN gateway to the NAS as a client? (Before anyone asks why I didn't just use the Syno as a VPN server- I had the Pi and wanted to make good use of it as well as PiHole) 
 Thanks so much in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK... I self hosted lots of media services, but I have the idea that choice can be a downside. For the older gang here... remember just turning on the TV at 1am when you got home from a night out and discovering an amazing new random film or when you are stuck at home sick watching bad daytime TV because their was no choice?!
 So here is the idea.. I have lots of content (have actually collected lots of bad TV, old commercials, great shows etc) and I would like to simulate TV channels from different places and times (currently have content for channels for "usa 80's" "USA early 90's" "UK 80's" and "soviet block early 70's")
 Wanted to ask you guys if you had ideas about setup... I can set this up, but most options seem like a pain!
 In a perfect world (perhaps asking too much!) - docker container - web interface - feed it a m3u or manage it inside? - able to do multiple streams 
 Even something that piggyback on jellyfin or plex?
 Any ideas?

 I still very new to all this but I am learning every day from all of you.
 Is anyone currently running vaultwarden with nginx proxy manager to manage the route to it and the cert?
 Just looking for a way to set it up. I believe if I set NPM up to use http and port 80 I can get a cert and it seems to work. I'm just wondering if that's the most secure way to run it.
 Previously I was running it using the docker compose documentation on vaultwarden wiki with Caddy for cert management almost exactly the way the documentation suggests. But I wanted to use NPM to point to some other VMs so I had to forward firewall ports 80 and 443 to that VM.
 Thanks for any help you can provide. Sorry if any of my terminology is incorrect!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently looking to upgrade from my tiny Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB Plex server so that I can scale to more powerful virtual servers and to switch over my costly cloud VPS services since seeing people on YouTube use VMWARE’s ESXI so that the server acts just like a virtual machine (NetworkChuck). 
 Mostly what I plan on running, a few servers, some on and off: 
  
Minecraft
 Terraria
 Wordpress
 Valheim (maybe… it gets a little demanding after a while)
 Vaultwarden
 Few other small things
  
I don’t want to spend too much (less than 600) but I am willing to spend a little more money if it would make a difference.
 Features I’m looking for:
  
Easily removable drives
 Ethernet (of course)
 64GB ram if possible
 An above average CPU
 Maybe put a little graphics card when I want so I can run plex arcade
  
This looks good to me
 I am looking for a server to slowly remove all the VPSs that I constantly pay for and want to go full self host since I am able to manage them on my own. I just can’t find the right specs and value, if anyone has a few in mind that would help.
 I am educated with the command line but not with ESXI or home/virtual server management. Yes I am looking to run multiple different operating systems and I prefer Ubuntu server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I have been playing around with self hosting this year. I want to take it a step further. I want to host Proxmox. I cannot build a server at home, I need to do it in the Cloud.
 I'm thinking about renting a dedicated server at Hetzner. I can rent it Germany for 47 euros a month, but in Finland it costs 41 euros a month. 
 I think it is a lot of money but I think I'm able to do it and I really like all the things I can do if I have a dedicated server. 
 ​
 Now, I have used iperf to test the internet connection. When my PC is the client I get about 10Mbit per second (my upload speed at home) with both servers in Germany and Finland. If my PC is the server, and I try iperf on a server in Germany as client I get 75Mbit per second (my download speed at home). If I try the server in Finland as client I get about 60Mbit per second, about 20% less when trying from Germany.
 The ping is 20ms to Germany but 40ms to Finland.
 ​
 I want to host things like, OpenVPN, PiHole, Bitwarden and much more on dedicated server. Basically I want to connect to the VPN server all the time, when I am at home or traveling or work. 
 Should I go with more expensive but closer internet connection or less expensive but a bit slower internet connection?
 I would like to go with the cheapest. Since I'm the only user on the dedicated server anyway. Does it matter so much I get a little bit lower bandwidth and a little bit higher ping???

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 With the recent google photos change I've decided that it might be a good time to upgrade my plex server in order to also host a service like Photoprism. The issue is that I'm currently running my plex server on an Alienware X51-R2, which is still running really well, but doesn't have room in the case/motherboard to add more drives and it's likely an absolute pain to transfer the system to a new case and upgrade to a new motherboard. 
 So the question I have for you guys is: what would you recommend I do? Should I buy a raid enclosure, external drives, or some other way to extend my storage on my Alienware X51-R2 or should I try to instead buy something like a Synology Nas?
 Some quick system details:
  
i5-3330
 8 GB of Ram
 GeForce GT 640
 1 TB hard drive

 My domain is on NameCheap, so I downloaded and installed their DDNS Client v2 and configured everything.
 When trying to access the proxied port(80), it just won't load. Like literally, my Firefox says that there's a problem with loading the page.
 I have tried messing around with my firewall but still nothing. I have opened a thread on Caddy's official forum. Sadly no progress yet.
 Here's the link: https://caddy.community/t/novice-trying-to-setup-reverse-proxy-from-on-node-js-app-from-port-3001-to-80-without-ssl/12815/6

 If someone can recommend the best approach it would be really helpful.

 Currently this does that by intercepting api calls for specific channels that the user sets, and injecting new messages into the websocket!
 Right now I'm cleaning up the code before I release a v1 version (plug and play program - one person hosts and others install and configs their clients)
 What I'm asking for you guys is feedback on how I should steer this project and anythings I should or shouldn't do in particular.
 If you find this concept interesting you can keep an eye on my discord server where I work with others on this project - the invite code is HwNAW2UdYW (I would link it but its so we don't get raided by bots - if u really want the invite DM me and I'll send it tmrw)

Let's pretend that my home network is 192.168.0.0 (which pfSense is connected on the WAN side on 192.168.0.x) and the lan side of pfSense is on another subnet, let's say 192.168.20.0. I can access the Web UI from my home network using 192.168.0.x and through the VMs at the lan address. In order to access the lan side of pfSense from my home network I set up a static route in my PC setting up the WAN pfSense address as a gateway. It doesn't work. I'm sure is a "dumb" question, but I really haven't got a clue. Any help? Love you people!

 Unforutnley I cant replicate this for OpenVPN, even after creating a default route to the OpenVPN IP, as well as the tunnel IP it assigns me, it still wont connect. I am unable to establish a connection unless the default 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.1 route is active (which I could remove afterwards, but this is a hassle and a leak if I forget)
 So why cant static default routes be made to the OpenVPN server, despite working with other VPN providers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all. So this started out as a small project, but it ended up being waaay more complicated than I thought it was going to be. I cracked the screen on my Pixel 4a and I found out it was gonna cost $230 to repair. You know what I can buy for $230? Another phone. I def downgraded, but I don't use my phone for much. So then I had this Pixel 4a that wasn't even a year old that Amazon was going to pay me $20-60 for. 
 I really just wanted to wipe it and put Linux on it, but apparently that's not actually a thing I can do like I can with a computer. And 4a isn't ported to Ubuntu Touch yet. So I came across Linux Deploy. I've been needing to setup a backup server anyway.
 ANYWAY, this ended up becoming a whole thing because I had to find a work around for just about everything (because of chroot/Android/aarch64/etc.....). And I did! I even got it working with external storage and LVM!! I posted a tutorial on everything (split into two parts, because it gets hairy and LVM is optional). This is Debian in chroot running UrBackup. This project isn't for everyone, especially because you're limited to EXT4 and it only works with Windows and Linux clients (no Mac).
 But if you have an Android phone sitting around and you need a backup server, you can give it a swing:
 https://www.hannahtech.co/post/turn-your-old-cracked-android-phone-into-a-backup-server-urbackup-linux-deploy-tutorial-part-i
 The biggest con is that you are, at the end of the day, still running Android. You can disable most services and apps, but if you're paranoid about Big Brother Google, this probably isn't for you.

 Working
  
qBittorrent web ui is accessible from other PCs, and can successfully download Linux ISOs.
  
Not Working
  
qBittorrent refuses to change the username/password from admin.
 I want to use filebrowser to access the torrented files via HTTP, but it refuses to run at all on the RPi. I think I got the armv7 build to run once, but after trying to install it as a service the way I did with qBittorrent, it crashes no matter how or where I run it.
 Though it felt like better practice to open the programs to Localhost and then proxy them to LAN subdomains using a server, I couldn't figure out Caddy which supposedly would have made this easy
  
To do - Possibly Wireguard remote access in the future? I found a pretty good guide
 Any help or suggestions, particularly with getting Filebrowser (or an alternative) to run would be appreciated!
 Many thanks!

 - Could I use a pi2 to self host it?
 - A free hosting service could be good? (Maybe I could get some type of financiation or ads?)
 ​
 *I have a static public IP
 *Pi2 is the only energy-efficient computer
 *Maybe I could have it 24/7
 *I don’t know anyway to hide my ip 
 *I don’t need to be in a search engine, as I can give the address to every class
 *Security is a must for my self hosted idea
 *I can get a SIM card with mobile data and host from there despite not being recommended 
 I won’t be hosting big files, just pdfs or images. Most of the contents would be linked to external pages (with permission from the author) Using ads won’t be bad I think (I’m a student so I won’t put ads that could distract people) but the ads should be 100% customisable (size, place And content?)
 Thanks again! You guys are the best community

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, it's my first post, so please be gentle. 
 I have a domain name called exampledomain.com that I would like to host a website on and ensure it's encrypted etc using SSL. I'm hosting the website on godaddy at the moment.
 I also have another web server at home that I'd like to expose to the internet securely with SSL. I'd like this address to be store.exampledomain.com
 in GoDaddy's DNS, I have an A record for store that points to my router at home.
 When it comes to SSL certificates, I'm confused how to implement this for both websites and more specifically, what type of cert I'll need. Or will I need two certificates? I currently have a SAN cert with up to 5 SAN's from godaddy.
 Generally, you need to submit a CSR to generate the cert from the server the website is on. So I do this on the server where exampledomain.com sits, then upload the CSR to godaddy and voila; I get my cert.
 However, now I want a cert for store.exampledomain.com so I need to go to my server at home hosting the website and generate a CSR for store. Is it just a matter of rekeying the certificate in GoDaddy now? Will that break the existing certificate for exampledomain.com?
 Any resources you could share that might educate me further would be helpful, also.
 So confused, eager to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently migrated from a custom built mergerfs on ubuntu system to a Synology device. Whether this is an upgrade or not is in question, but I wanted a level of redundancy, a nicer heat solution and something which would just work so I didn't have to worry about storage when selfhosting. 
 I've been using NFS for a while, with user accounts stored in AD. Pre-synology it worked great; realm join and we're off and running. NFS with sec=sys worked wonders because each user had the same uid/gid everywhere.
 My primary use cases are 2 docker hosts. I'd mount the nfs share on each host, then each container runs as a set user and only has access to their own directories. It's magic. One mount and the rest takes care of itself.
 In this new synology world, it's not as easy. It generates different uids than everything else on the network so sec=sys doesn't work. I had a stab at nfs idmapping and it doesn't seem to work. Google is a mixed bag but the consensus is this isn't the answer (and may even be a synology quirk).
 The answer seems to be either; 
  
chmod -R 777
 manage uids manually (ergh...)
 kerberos
 samba
  
I'm new to kerberos but I think I'm beginning to slowly get it. Is it worth it? 
 Kerberos & Samba also may mean I need to manually mount each share under different user accounts. This feels cleaner but a relative pain in the arse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey I recently started using Cadvisor in combination with prometheus in Docker images, this works well, however I see that Cadvisor takes up a lot of RAM. probably because it has to monitor a lot of docker images (65 at the moment) and collect and forward information about them.. is there any suggestion how i can reduce this? is there maybe an environment variable i can use or a setting? my docker compose looks like this ( excluded prometheus and the grafana part. but I can share these also if needed)
 cadvisor: image: google/cadvisor network: - internal hostname: cadvisor volume: - /:/rootfs:ro - /var/run:/var/run:rw - /sys:/sys:ro - /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker:ro - /cgroup:/cgroup:ro deploy: tags: - org.label-schema.group=monitoring

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I've made a small script to easily get you started with LinuxServer.io applications using docker-compose. I personally find it very useful to quickly install an application and try it out. Hopefully it will help you too.
 The script getlsioapp.sh allows you to install a LinuxServer.io application in less than 10 seconds. It will automatically create the necessary volume directories on the host and automatically create the correct docker-compose configuration file. The docker-compose configuration file includes a description of all environment variables, volume- and port mappings.
 More info here.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a few things running beind nginx proxy manager and they all work because the basic http(s)://IP:port request locally auto loads the desired location. For example, my nextcloud instance loads /index.php/login.
 I just installed an app (azuracast after reading the other thread), but the way that works is http(s)://x.x.x.x:port loads /login or /dashboard if you are logged in. Thats the admin dashboard but I am trying to expose the "public" page which is:
 http(s)://x.x.x.x:port/public/stationName 
 And the port is the same for the management dashboard. 
 Anyone know how to accomplish that with nginx proxy manager? When trying to use the custom locations setting I still just get directed to the main management page. nginx conf here https://pastebin.com/raw/rKM6kB3F

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an account for the oracle free tier, and I've been using one of the hosts to only host a teamspeak server, nothing else. I had the server running for almost a year, with no issues, until I started getting emails about abuse warning with the following message:
 Oracle has received notice of or detected unusual and potentially harmful activity originating from the indicated resource in your tenancy.
 Traffic Details: Outbound Port Scanning, Brute-forcing, Web Exploitation, and/or DDoS 
 I unfortunately do not have a support subscription, so I am unable to log a ticket to inquire about it. 
 I've tried some of the basic security controls they suggest like making sure OS is up to date, disable password login, change ssh port. I also installed sshguard and fail2ban to help make sure my machine is more secure.
 They have since disabled the host, but I am able to clone the boot volume and then make a new instance from that clone to still have my vm, but then it's around a week or two until it gets disabled and I have to repeat this.
 I have no idea where to start looking or what to do to address this issue? I would greatly appreciate if anyone has any advice or help on what I can do to resolve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have all of my domains on GoDaddy (not my original choice but it works for everything else so I am not interested in switching) and their Ultimate Linux Hosting package which includes cPanel and SSH access as well as the regular GoDaddy management tools. 
 I have a few subdomains that I use for things like Nextcloud, Gitea, etc. that I host on a server in my basement.
 When I try to issue an SSL cert using Let's Encrypt, I have to issue it on GoDaddy and then have to install the certs through cPanel, and then copy those certs from cPanel to my server for HTTPS to work. When I try to issue the certs directly on my server, HTTPS does not work. Basically this is the breakdown:
  
SSH into cPanel.
 
Run acme.sh and create the cert.
 
Copy the cert information to the SSL manager in cPanel.
 
Copy those same certs to my SSL folder on my server at home.
 
Update my home webserver's vhost config to point to the correct server.
 
SSL is now set up and HTTPS should be working correctly. Repeat steps 1-4 to update the cert.
 
 Is this behavior correct or am I doing something wrong? I have an A record in my GoDaddy DNS for each subdomain (nextcloud.domain.tld, git.domain.tld) and don't have any files on GoDaddy itself; if I were to shut off my port forward you wouldn't see anything at all. Yet the SSL certs have to be managed through cPanel first, then copied to my webserver for https to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. Sorry if this is not the most appropriate subreddit for this type of question, but I feel kinda lost here.
 So, I'm using a RPI4 to self host a discord bot I developed, along with some (micro)services the bot depends on, all running on docker. 
 I managed to setup github actions to test, build and deploy the nodejs services on docker hub and everything is working fine. However, I'd like to up the ante a little and accomplish a fully automated deploying system. Right now, after the new docker images are pushed to docker hub, I still need to manually SSH into the RPI and use docker-compose to pull and run the containers again.
 My question is: how can I "trigger" my RPI to auto pull the new images (and run the containers again) after gihub actions pushes to docker hub?
 PS: I've heard of watchtower, and while that does work, it's not exactly what I'm looking for. Since it runs on a schedule, it doesn't update the images right after they're pushed to docker hub. Also, I'm aware that docker has put on some limits to pulls/day for free users, so that would make the watchtower rollouts even slower.
 Sorry for the somewhat long post, and thanks in advance!

 I am looking for a foss alternative to google photos. I would prefer it to have a webapp or apps for Mac, android, iOS, windows- almost everything. I also want the app to function as a gallery app, much like google photos on Android. 
 The main feature I am looking for is for Ai face, thing, and place recognition. With pretrained models or self training. (So if it doesn't recognize something I could teach it to with pictures.)
 A lot of the ones I have been looking for don't have the ai feature, which really makes me exit the tab.
 Comment if you find/know of any software like this.

 so recently I asked myself how you build these binary files files for full stack applications.
 Take Plex as an example, if you go on their website you can download a server file as an binary compatible with your system (.exe, .dmg, .sh, etc), which includes the webversion of Plex and the whole backend. So I was wondering how you are able to do that, since it will probably also help with building single docker images instead of stacks which I currently use to combine frontend and backend. 
 Does anyone know how its done or know an open source example for the building process?
 Thanks for the help!
