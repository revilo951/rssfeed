I wanted something with group management and OU hierarchies that sort of follow what you would use in Active Directory. I found a lot of issues with some of the more well recommended solutions out there:
  
Samba: It's basically an AD Domain Controller which was more than I needed; also while being feature-familiar with AD is nice, I'm not looking to implement AD, I'm looking to really stick closer to just LDAP.
 GLAuth: Interesting project, but is somewhat limited in the attributes it can handle, how group management works, how the OU structure is reflected in group membership, and usability. GLauth-ui is an interesting component …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, not sure if this is the right place, but Im not sure how to google this without getting noise. I'm currently running Ubuntu as a VM on a mac mini. On that VM, i have about 20 docker containers running, including (but not limited too) Home assistant, Node Red, Pihole, Heimdal, Grocy, Organizr, Portainer, Grafana, InfluxDB, Zwave2Mqtt, ESPHome and some others.
 ​
 This afternoon, Im no longer able to access any of the web addresses, the folders shared via samba, or even SSH into the virtual machine. I can still access it on my virtual box when connecting to the mac mini. I've tried restarting and shutting down the VM, and even restarting services. Any idea what other options exist to try and get these functioning?
 I should mention that the docker containers are definitely running. And i can access home assistant through nabucasa. And automations and alexa integrations still work. I just can't access any services using the VM IP or Samab or SSH
 Never had to troubleshoot linux like this before. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks for any ideas and help.

This way I could keep track things like the buy date, price, information / description and age of the various models and accessories.
 Does anyone know of self-hosted software that would achieve this?
 I figured a finances manager, like firefly iii can be used to track the items as assets, but it would be nice if there's something more specific for this use case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone !
 I'm very exited to share with you how how I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps left by the death of google play music : the lack of possibility to synchronize playlists in an efficient way
 As google play music user my main usage was to upload my music and use it to download albums, artists or playlistson my mobile. Despite all my research I have not found anything that allows to do this with self-hosted services.
 The solution I'm presenting to you today is very simple but took me several months of reflection (without exaggerating (even if I didn't put all my brain cells into it)).
 What my solution allows me to now : - Extract all my jellyfin playlists (probably works with emby) - Make all the files available for syncing with an app on my smartphone (FolderSync) - Make all the file on my smartphone easily usable with my default music player (PlayerAmp)
 You can find my script and the explanations on the github repository : https://github.com/Totonyus/jellyfin_playlists_sync
 I'm really proud of what I achieved today with this solution. It totally fulfil my needs and fills something I missed a lot since the end of google play music (I still hate google for that)
 I hope it will be useful to some people. Whether it's using the solution I propose or a solution based on the same principle but better suited to your own needs.
 I am of course open to all discussions and suggestions.
 PS : I'm not a native english speaker, I do my best.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[title, I've been working on this on-off the last 2 years, but most progress was made the last year (lockdown amiright).
 The point is to scan your local NSFW videos & images and provide a way to organize all of that stuff. Makes it easy to search for specific content (unwatched scenes, bookmarks, ratings etc) (like: "show me all videos I've never watched featuring blondes" or whatever). Media can then be accessed by any device with a web browser.
 The app supports videos (scenes), actors/actresses, movies, studios (including substudios, networks), images and scene chapters (markers). Future versions will also support image albums.
 It scales very nicely, doesn't matter if you just have a couple of files or 10s of TB of data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I am lookign for a self-hosted app that has good random photo features like creating clickable random gallery / picture wall from the root folder or from the current gallery. 
  
It can create random gallery on demand
 It can create random gallery based on the currently open gallery
 It can access to the local files (so no database import)
  
I use Piwigo for this but the random stuff is very limited, and it pulls from the root albums so %95 of the the time that is not what I need. Also it does not look like there is a way to number of photo shown, it is a fixed number.
 I do not want to use static page generators since I need this stuff to be generated on demand, static page gens are useless in this case.
 thanks

 Right now i am trying to learn svelte as my FE framework.

 So i was wondering if running selfhost apps allows me to sharpen my skill in the cicd and mnaging server part or even other than that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm setting up a new home server and before I can get anything done I need to solve a unknown ssh issue.
 Heres the issue.
 ssh PC ---> New Server : ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh PC ----> Old server: works
 ssh Old Server ----> New Server: works
 ssh Mobile phone ----> New Server: works
 ssh New Server----> Old Server: works
 ssh Old Server---> PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.155 port 22: Refused This makes sense
 ssh New Server ---> PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 ssh Mobile ---->PC: ssh: connection to host 192.168.0.150 port 22: Connection timed out
 Things I've tried:
  
Restarting all the machines involved
 Restarting the ssh client on the new server
 Turning off all the firewalls (PC and New Server)
 Enabling ssh on UFW
 Tried Reinstalling the ssh client on the new server (This changed the fingerprint, but the old server could still connect to get the changed host error)
 Pinging the New Server from the PC works. Same ping as to the old one.
  
Things I've done to the new server:
  
Apt update && apt upgrade
 apt install nvidia-headless-460-server
 echo "blacklist floppy" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-floppy.conf Do to an I/O error I dont't have a floppy
  
That's it. That is all I've done since a clean install on bare metal. The whole thing is running on a btrfs file system if that matters. I haven't enabled any encryption or anything else yet.
 This ssh service on the new server logs events for the clients that work but nothing at all coming from the PC. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea why it isn't working. I didn't test the ssh prior to the three changes above so I do not know if this was an issue previously.
 Both the old and the new server are running off the same installation image of Ubuntu server 20.04
 I would really like to get this working since I almost exclusively interact with the server using VScode on the PC.

 For fpm docker images, what's the difference between images that use alpine and those that don't?
 I'm aware that alpine is one of the leanest containers out there, but is there any drawback from using alpine in production?
 If not, then why don't all apps just skip fpm and go straight for fpm-alpine instead of giving the option for non alpine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have decided to re-setup my self hosted services. Runs under docker with traefik(1.7) as a reverse proxy/ssl provider (lets encrypt). traefik has a middle ware thing called traefik-forward-auth that allows you to tap into an oauth provider to secure your services. One of the services I was hoping to run is ttrss, which works almost perfectly. Thing is, none of the android applications seem to be able to deal with the oauth redirection going on. As a middle ground i have disabled oauth for that subdomain, enabled basic http auth and then the authentication provided by the ttrss app.
 I don't like not having a unified auth system but i also really need to use an app instead of the web browser on my phone (pre-caching/better formatting). Can anyone point me in the right direction? Only thing i can think of is finding a custom theme that has great mobile support? Maybe I'm being too paranoid (probably) and ill be fine with the two layers of basic auth.
 I'm curious how other people have this set up?
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is all my setup I went through over a few days of trial and error to get myself a proper sandbox'd environment for my cameras.
 I have multiple Reolink cameras connected by a PoE switch to my Raspberry pi, which acts as a DHCP server for them and runs Shinobi as the cam software.
 All camera viewing then has to be performed through the Shinobi software, which is hosted instead off my local subnet.
 The trick is utilizing the Raspberry Pi's wifi module + its ethernet port, allowing you to sandbox off the cameras to the Ethernet subnet (and thus requires a direct physical connection to access their data), and then view the camera footage over the wifi subnet (through your home router)
 I also have a NGINX configured reverse proxy server I use, as I have a website domain I host my stuff off of, which lets me access shinobi from anywhere (but requires login of course)
 Result: DIY Reverse Proxied Sandbox'd DVR

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for suggestions on software, or even ideas on how to plan this out.
 We're moving house and we need new furniture for everything since our current place has it all provided.
 I was thinking of a Kanban board of some kind. Maybe one board for each room and each big item could be a "ticket" (sofa/fridge etc). Then I could have To Buy/Bought/Delivered for each column and drag each item as needed. Suggestions for each item could be added as comments.
 Does this seem like a good idea? Or is there any other way people could think to organise something like this? I would love it if there were metadata that could be assigned to each item, so I could have a cost associated to a ticket then for each room I could see how much has been spent etc.
 Whatever solution has to be able to support images on tickets. Ideally I have to get my fiance to use and if the UI is not somewhat pretty/modern I know for a fact she won't use it, no matter how good it is. I’m not sure on Kanban because I need mobile for this and from what I’ve seen a lot of them aren’t responsive on an iPhone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there - I'm pretty new to things like this but I was wondering if anyone may be able to help me.
 Say I have a webapp and I'm using something like localhost.run to expose this app that's running on my local port 5000.
 I run something like:
 ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 localhost.run 
 and now have a nice little link like:
 https://081e35c0012dd4.localhost.run 
 that I can share with the world. This seems nice, but also very insecure. Is it possible to secure this a bit more - namely without needing to self host my own server. In this case localhost.run is taking a lot of the work out of maintaining my own server and things are quite easy.
 One of my use cases is testing webhooks. For example, say the webhooks I'm testing publish which IP addresses you can expect the requests to be coming from. How would I go about allowlisting only these IP addresses to access my newly exposed app, if at all possible?
 Thanks!

A reverse proxy should take care of redirecting external incoming request to the appropriate webserver. But I am unsure about the internal clients. Should they also use the reverse proxy (Variant 1) or connect directly to the webservers (Variant 2)?
 What is your best practice?
 How do you handle certificates?
 I am fan of having the same url for external and internal clients and using offical CAs (like LetsEncrypt) for internal FQDNs. Thanks anyone for your feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been happily running all my selfhosted stuff on a headless Ubuntu Server using VirtualBox for almost a decade now. While I've got a few services running in containers/snaps, but most are installed manually on a VM. This system works, but it seems that there's newer tech that is far more convenient. I'm super interested in Infrastructure as Code (making config more accessible) & allowing more modularity (eg: swarm style systems), and probably other features I'm not even aware of! I'm less thrilled about the weaker isolation a container offers over a VM, but I could always run a container INSIDE of a VM.
 ​
 While this has been on my back burner for a while now, I have recently acquired a 2nd server, so both the opportunity to start fresh & the opportunity to make my own cloud/cluster/whatever are now much more real!
 ​
 I suppose the question here is--what resources do you know about for moving from VM based infrastructure to IaC based. Eg: I'm under the impression that the default used to be K8 & Docker & Ansible, but now it seems that K8 & Docker don't play nice anymore--so what are you all using now?
 ​
 Edit:It came up that the fact that I run ~35 VMs is of importance for scale/management. I also run LDAP (not whole home) & 3 node Galera Cluster (HA MariaDB).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We are using OnlyOffice self hosted but only as groupware email solution - we have around 100 users, and every user has 2-5 external mailboxes connected via imap to external mail server. OnlyOffice mail app is very nice with pre-fetching all new mails to database, with index/search and unified inbox. But we are looking forward to move to any other software. We tried:
  
Nextcloud - great app, but with very slow any buggy mail app (without pre-fetch/search).
 Groupoffice - nice, but no pre-fetch too.
 Railloop / Roundcube / Sogo / etc - not an option, because we need to create a users first, and then connect external imap accounts.
 Cypth - is good php project but also without pre-fetch / search index. 
 Zimbra / all other full stack mail solution - not an option, because we are using existing external mail server and don't want to move mx'es to our new self hosted.
  
So, we are looking for any webmail groupware which is able to:
  
Create users to login into we system (not into the mailbox) using any 2FA.
 Connect external imap mailboxes to users accounts.
 Pre-fetch all new mail via imap from external server with indexing / search.
 It's ok to have a paid solution, but it must be self hosted and (easily) customisable.
  
Many thanks for any suggestions!

 Does anyone run it? How is the performance? Did you have to use AWS s3 or does it store files locally?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friends are finally considering moving away from Discord after recent drama, and I've been searching for a suitable program for a few months. I have looked at and rejected Mattermost (doesn't have the permissions I need) and Rocket.Chat (has half the permissions but runs too slow). 
 What I really need is a chat server that can be used to restrict file uploads to specific rooms or user roles, and, at the very least, has the capability to create an 'arrivals' system, where users show up to a single room before being invited to the chat at large. My friends have servers which have had persistent trolls, and I really don't want to have to clear out Cartel videos from unrelated chats every day. 
 I'm currently looking at Matrix and Zulip, but it's unclear if either are capable of this, and it might not be possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't used it, Tailscale solves so many problems with connectivity / port forwarding / security. Run it on all your machines and log in, and they're all connected and their hostnames resolve (i.e. http://mycomputer:8080). It solves One Problem, with absolutely zero config headache. I see a lot of people recommending setting up VPN or Wireguard and, if you don't mind that Tailscale isn't fully selfhosted, it solves that problem in a much easier way
 It is also great for security because it means that lots of services that you'd want to make a public endpoint for (i.e. Bitwarden) can now be accessed via Tailscale instead, which means that your public surface area for e.g. a VPS can be extremely small or even zero (i.e. no inbound ports)
 I have no association with the project btw, I'm solely an extremely happy free-tier user

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
